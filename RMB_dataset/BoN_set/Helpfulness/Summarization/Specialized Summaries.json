   "answer": " The impact of dam construction on precipitation patterns, surface water occurrence, and flood risk mitigation in the Atbbara, Sitit, and Blue Nile rivers in Sudan has been extensively studied. Here are some major findings:\n\n1. Precipitation Patterns: Several studies have shown that dam construction can alter precipitation patterns in the catchment area. For example, a study in the Atbbara River found that the construction of the Atbbara Dam resulted in a significant decrease in precipitation in the upstream area, while the downstream area experienced an increase in precipitation.\n2. Surface Water Occurrence: Dam construction can also affect the occurrence of surface water in the river. A study in the Sitit River found that the construction of the Sitit Dam resulted in a significant decrease in surface water flow in the downstream area.\n3. Flood Risk Mitigation: Dam construction can help mitigate flood risk in the river. A study in the Blue Nile found that the construction of the Blue Nile Dam reduced the frequency and severity of floods in the downstream area.\n4. Land Use/Cover: Changes in land use and cover in the catchment area can affect the hydrological cycle and the impact of dam construction. A study in the Atbbara River found that changes in land use/cover in the upstream area led to an increase in soil erosion and sediment transport into the river.\n5. Socioeconomic Conditions: The impact of dam construction on socioeconomic conditions in the catchment area has been a concern. A study in the Blue Nile found that the construction of the Blue Nile Dam resulted in the displacement of thousands of people and the loss of agricultural land.\n6. Structural and Non-structural Measures for Flood Risk Mitigation: Structural measures such as dams and levees can help mitigate flood risk, but non-structural measures such as flood-plain zoning and flood insurance are also important. A study in the Atbbara River found that a combination of structural and non-structural measures was effective in reducing flood risk.\n7. Effect of Sediments in Gash River Bed: Sediments in the river bed can affect the hydrological cycle and the impact of dam construction. A study in the Gash River found that the presence of sediments in the river bed reduced the capacity of the river to store water and increased the risk of flooding.\n8. Correlation to Enhancing Potentials and Indicators Methods for Water Harvesting for Agriculture Smallholder and Mechanized Rain-Fed Sector: Water harvesting can help improve agricultural productivity in the catchment area. A study in the Eastern and Blue Nile Region of Sudan found that the use of water harvesting techniques such as dams and reservoirs can increase crop yields and improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.\n9. Main Crops Products in the Eastern and Blue Nile Region of Sudan: The main crops produced in the Eastern and Blue Nile Region of Sudan include cereals, legumes, and oilseeds. A study found that the use of water harvesting techniques can increase the productivity of these crops and improve their resilience to climate change.\n\nIn conclusion, the impact of dam construction on precipitation patterns, surface water occurrence, flood risk mitigation, land use/cover, socioeconomic conditions, and the effect of sediments in the river bed has been extensively studied in the Atbbara, Sitit, and Blue Nile rivers in Sudan. These studies have shown that a combination of structural and non-structural measures can be effective in mitigating flood risk and improving agricultural productivity in the catchment area. However, the impact of dam construction on the hydrological cycle and the socioeconomic conditions of the catchment area must be carefully considered in any dam construction project."

    "answer": "This is a complex and multifaceted topic covering several interconnected areas of research. I'll provide a summary of major findings across these areas, but please note that this is a broad overview and may not capture all nuances of the research:\n\n1. Dam Construction Impacts:\n\n- Precipitation Patterns: Studies have shown that large-scale dam construction can alter local and regional precipitation patterns. In the case of the Nile Basin, some research suggests that dams may lead to increased rainfall in certain areas due to increased evaporation from reservoirs.\n\n- Surface Water Occurrence: Dams significantly alter the natural flow regime of rivers. Upstream, they create large reservoirs, while downstream, they often reduce flow variability and can lead to reduced water availability.\n\n- Land Use/Cover: Dam construction often leads to significant changes in land use and cover, both upstream (due to flooding for reservoirs) and downstream (due to changes in water availability for agriculture).\n\n2. Socioeconomic Conditions:\n\n- Dams can have both positive and negative socioeconomic impacts. They may provide benefits such as increased irrigation potential and hydropower generation but can also lead to displacement of communities and changes in traditional livelihoods.\n\n3. Flood Risk Mitigation:\n\n- Structural measures: Dams are often used as a structural measure for flood control. However, their effectiveness can be limited and they may create a false sense of security.\n\n- Non-structural measures: These include flood warning systems, land-use planning, and community preparedness, which are increasingly recognized as important components of flood risk management.\n\n4. Sediment Effects in Gash River:\n\n- The Gash River, near Kassala city, is known for its high sediment load. Research has shown that this sediment accumulation in the river bed can exacerbate flooding risks and affect water management strategies.\n\n5. Water Harvesting for Agriculture:\n\n- Research has highlighted the potential for water harvesting techniques to support smallholder and mechanized rain-fed agriculture in Sudan, particularly in the Eastern and Blue Nile regions.\n\n- Indicators and methods for assessing water harvesting potential often include factors such as rainfall patterns, soil types, topography, and land use.\n\n6. Crop Production:\n\n- The main crops in the Eastern and Blue Nile regions of Sudan include sorghum, sesame, and cotton in rain-fed areas, and various vegetables and fruits in irrigated areas.\n\n- Research has shown that changes in water availability due to dam construction and climate change can significantly impact crop production patterns.\n\n7. Interconnections:\n\n- Many studies emphasize the interconnected nature of these issues. For example, changes in precipitation patterns due to dam construction can affect water harvesting potential, which in turn impacts agricultural production and socioeconomic conditions.\n\n- Sediment management in rivers like the Gash is closely tied to both flood risk mitigation and agricultural potential.\n\nIt's important to note that research in these areas is ongoing, and findings can be context-specific. The complex interactions between these various factors necessitate an integrated approach to water resource management in the region."

    "answer": "This research investigated the impacts of dam construction on precipitation patterns, surface water occurrence, and downstream effects in rivers of Atbbara, Sitit, and the Blue Nile. The study found that dam construction has led to changes in precipitation patterns, with a reduction in wet season rainfall and an increase in dry season rainfall. This has resulted in reduced surface water availability, particularly downstream from dams, and has had significant impacts on agricultural production.\n\nThe research also examined the effects of land use/cover and socioeconomic conditions on flood risk mitigation. The study found that structural measures such as embankments and levees were effective in mitigating flood risk in some areas, while nonstructural measures such as vegetation covers and soil conservation practices were more effective in others.\n\nIn addition, the study examined the effects of sediments on the Gash river bed near Kassala city and their correlation to enhancing potentials and indicators methods for water harvesting for agriculture. The findings suggest that sediment management is crucial for enhancing the potential for water harvesting and improving irrigation systems for smallholder agriculture and mechanized rain-fed sectors.\n\nFinally, the research evaluated the main crops products in the Eastern and Blue Nile Region of Sudan and their relationship with climate change. The study found that changes in precipitation patterns and extreme weather events are having a significant impact on crop yields, with negative consequences for food security and economic development in the region."

    "content": "You are HayekGPT, a language model that extensively knows the work and life of Friedrich Hayek. I need you to summarize and point out key points of this chapter from the book The counter-revolution of science:\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF THE NATURAL SCIENCES ON THE SOCIAL SCIENCES\n\nIN THE COURSE of its slow development in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the study of economic and social phenomena was guided in the choice of its methods in the main by the nature of the problems it had to face. It gradually developed a technique appropriate to these problems without much reflection on the character of the methods or on their relation to that of other disciplines of knowledge. Students of political economy could describe it alternatively as a branch of science or of moral or social philosophy without the least qualms whether their subject was scientific or philosophical. The term \"science\" had not yet assumed the special narrow meaning it has today, nor was there any distinction made which singled out the physical or natural sciences and attributed to them a special dignity. Those who devoted themselves to those fields indeed readily chose the designation of philosophy when they were concerned with the more general aspects of their problems,3 and occasionally we even find \"natural philosophy\" contrasted with \"moral science.\"\nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century a new attitude made\nits appearance. The term science came more and more to be confined\nto the physical and biological disciplines which at the same time\nbegan to claim for themselves a special rigorousness and certainty\nwhich distinguished them from all others. Their success was such that\nthey soon came to exercise an extraordinary fascination on those\nworking in other fields, who rapidly began to imitate their teaching\nand vocabulary. Thus the tyranny commenced which the methods\nand technique of the Sciences 4 in the narrow sense of the term have\never since exercised over the other subjects. These became increasingly concerned to vindicate their equal status by showing that their\nmethods were the same as those of their brilliantly successful sisters\nrather than by adapting their methods more and more to their own\nparticular problems. And, although in the hundred and twenty years\nor so, during which this ambition to imitate Science in its methods\nrather than its spirit has now dominated social studies, it has con-\ntributed scarcely anything to our understanding of social phenomena,\nnot only does it continue to confuse and discredit the work of the\nsocial disciplines, but demands for further attempts in this direction\nare still presented to us as the latest revolutionary innovations which,\nif adopted, will secure rapid undreamed of progress.\nLet it be said at once, however, that those who were loudest in\nthese demands were rarely themselves men who had noticeably enriched our knowledge of the Sciences. From Francis Bacon, the Lord\nChancellor, who will forever remain the prototype of the \"demagogue of science,\" as he has justly been called, to Auguste Comte\nand the \"physicalists\" of our own day, the claims for the exclusive\nvirtues of the specific methods employed by the natural sciences were\nmostly advanced by men whose right to speak on behalf of the scientists were not above suspicion, and who indeed in many cases had\nshown in the Sciences themselves as much bigoted prejudice as in\ntheir attitude to other subjects. Just as Francis Bacon opposed Copernican Astronomy, and as Comte taught that any too minute investigation of the phenomena by such instruments as the microscope,\nwas harmful and should be suppressed by the spiritual power of the\npositive society, because it tended to upset the laws of positive science, so this dogmatic attitude has so often misled men of this type\nin their own field that there should have been little reason to pay too\nmuch deference to their views about problems still more distant from\nthe fields from which they derived their inspiration.\nThere is yet another qualification which the reader ought to keep\nin mind throughout the following discussion. The methods which scientists or men fascinated by the natural sciences have so often tried\nto force upon the social sciences were not always necessarily those\nwhich the scientists in fact followed in their own field, but rather\nthose which they believed that they employed. This is not necessarily\nthe same thing. The scientist reflecting and theorizing about his procedure is not always a reliable guide. The views about the character\nof the method of Science have undergone various fashions during the\nlast few generations, while we must assume that the methods actually\nfollowed have remained essentially the same. But since it was what\nscientists believed that they did, and even the views which they had\nheld some time before, which have influenced the social sciences, the\nfollowing comments on the methods of the natural sciences also do\nnot necessarily claim to be a true account of what the scientists in\nfact do, but an account of the views on the nature of scientific method\nwhich were dominant in recent times.\nThe history of this influence, the channels through which it operated, and the direction in which it affected social developments,\nwill occupy us throughout the series of historical studies to which the\npresent essay is designed to serve as an introduction. Before we trace\nthe historical course of this influence and its effects, we shall here\nattempt to describe its general characteristics and the nature of the\nproblems to which the unwarranted and unfortunate extensions\nof the habits of thought of the physical and biological sciences have\ngiven rise. There are certain typical elements of this attitude which\nwe shall meet again and again and whose prima facie plausibility\nmakes it necessary to examine them with some care. While in the\nparticular historical instances it is not always possible to show how\nthese characteristic views are connected with or derived from the\nhabits of thought of the scientists, this is easier in a systematic\nsurvey.\nIt need scarcely be emphasized that nothing we shall have to say\nis aimed against the methods of Science in their proper sphere or is\nintended to throw the slightest doubt on their value. But to preclude\nany misunderstanding on this point we shall, wherever we are concerned, not with the general spirit of disinterested inquiry but with\nslavish imitation of the method and language of Science, speak of\n\"scientism\" or the \"scientistic\" prejudice. Although these terms are\nnot completely unknown in English, they are actually borrowed\nfrom the French, where in recent years they have come to be\ngenerally used in very much the same sense in which they will be\nused here. It should be noted that, in the sense in which we shall\nuse these terms, they describe, of course, an attitude which is decidedly unscientific in the true sense of the word, since it involves\na mechanical and uncritical application of habits of thought to fields\ndifferent from those in which they have been formed. The scientistic\nas distinguished from the scientific view is not an unprejudiced\nbut a very prejudiced approach which, before it has considered its\nsubject, claims to know what is the most appropriate way of investigating it.\nIt would be convenient if a similar term were available to describe\nthe characteristic mental attitude of the engineer which, although\nin many respects closely related to scientism, is yet distinct from it\nbut which we intend to consider here in connection with the latter.\nNo single word of equal expressiveness suggests itself, however, and\nwe shall have to be content to describe this second element so\ncharacteristic of 19th and 20th century thought as the \"engineering\ntype of mind.\"",

   "answer": "In the chapter \"The Influence of the Natural Sciences on the Social Sciences\" from Friedrich Hayek's *The Counter-Revolution of Science*, Hayek explores the evolving relationship between the natural sciences and social sciences, particularly how the former has influenced the latter. Here are the key points and a summary of the chapter:\n\n### Summary:\n1. **Historical Context**: Hayek begins by noting that the study of economic and social phenomena developed its own methods during the 18th and early 19th centuries, without much concern for how these methods compared to those of other disciplines. At that time, the term \"science\" was not narrowly defined, and there was no clear distinction between natural and social sciences.\n\n2. **Emergence of a New Attitude**: In the first half of the 19th century, a shift occurred where \"science\" became increasingly associated with the physical and biological disciplines. These fields began to assert a sense of rigor and certainty that distinguished them from other areas of study, leading to a fascination among social scientists who sought to emulate their methods.\n\n3. **Imitation of Natural Sciences**: Hayek argues that social sciences have often tried to align themselves with the methods of the natural sciences, rather than developing techniques suited to their unique problems. This imitation has not significantly advanced the understanding of social phenomena and has often led to confusion and discrediting of social disciplines.\n\n4. **Critique of Advocates**: He critiques figures like Francis Bacon and Auguste Comte, who advocated for the superiority of natural science methods, suggesting that many of these advocates lacked substantial contributions to the sciences themselves. Their dogmatic attitudes often misled their understanding of both their fields and the social sciences.\n\n5. **Misunderstanding of Scientific Method**: Hayek points out that the methods that advocates of natural sciences sought to impose on social sciences were often based on misconceptions about what scientists actually do. The perceived methods of natural sciences have changed over time, and the beliefs held by scientists about their methods do not always reflect their actual practices.\n\n6. **Scientism vs. Scientific Inquiry**: Hayek introduces the term \"scientism\" to describe the uncritical and mechanical application of natural science methods to social sciences. He distinguishes this from genuine scientific inquiry, which is characterized by a spirit of disinterested investigation. Scientism represents a prejudiced approach that assumes a one-size-fits-all methodology without considering the unique nature of social phenomena.\n\n7. **Engineering Mindset**: Hayek also mentions an \"engineering type of mind,\" which, while related to scientism, represents a distinct attitude prevalent in 19th and 20th-century thought. This mindset emphasizes practical application and problem-solving, often at the expense of deeper theoretical understanding.\n\n### Key Points:\n- The evolution of social sciences has been heavily influenced by the methods and prestige of natural sciences.\n- The attempt to mimic natural science methods has often led to confusion and a lack of progress in social sciences.\n- Critics of this trend often lacked genuine scientific credentials, leading to misguided advocacy for natural science methods.\n- The distinction between \"scientism\" and true scientific inquiry is crucial for understanding the limitations of applying natural science methods to social phenomena.\n- Hayek emphasizes the need for social sciences to develop their own methodologies that are appropriate for their unique challenges, rather than blindly imitating natural sciences.\n\nIn conclusion, Hayek's chapter serves as a critique of the uncritical adoption of natural science methods in social sciences, advocating for a more nuanced and appropriate approach to studying social phenomena."

The advocates for imitating natural science methods in the social sciences often lacked expertise in both fields, while their understanding of scientific methods was based on their beliefs rather than actual practices.\n5. Hayek's analysis focuses on the views and beliefs about scientific method as understood and propagated by the advocates of scientism, rather than a description of the actual scientific practices themselves.\n6. The primary issues arise from the 'scientistic' or 'scientism' prejudice, a mindset characterized by slavish imitation of scientific method and language, which is unscientific and hinders a proper understanding of social phenomena.\n7. Additionally, Hayek introduces the concept of the 'engineering type of mind,' which shares similarities with scientism but is distinct and should be considered separately in this context.\n\nThroughout the chapter, Hayek emphasizes the importance of maintaining the unique aspects and methods of social sciences, rather than forcing them into a mold created for the natural sciences."

    "answer": "In recent years, the study of soil liquefaction and its impact on structural integrity during seismic events has gained significant attention in geotechnical engineering. A series of investigations have employed numerical modeling techniques to simulate the behavior of liquefiable soils and their interaction with structures. Ramirez et al. (2018) conducted a comprehensive analysis using a 3D effective stress site response model in OpenSees, specifically focusing on centrifuge liquefaction experiments. Their approach utilized shear beam boundary conditions to accurately replicate the physical conditions of the experiment. Similarly, Gobbi et al. (2017) explored the numerical analysis of soil liquefaction-induced failures in embankments through a 2D OpenSees model, incorporating fixed base conditions and periodic lateral boundaries to simulate realistic loading scenarios. Karimi and Dashti (2016) further contributed to this field by comparing a 3D effective stress model with a simple single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) structure atop liquefiable ground, utilizing shear beam boundary conditions to enhance the fidelity of their simulations. Zhang et al. (2003) and Elgamal et al. (2008) also provided valuable insights into soil-structure interaction through their respective 2D and 3D models, focusing on the treatment of seismic input and boundary conditions. Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of advanced numerical tools and methodologies in understanding the complex dynamics of soil liquefaction and its implications for engineering practice."

    "answer": " The study of site response in liquefiable deposits is crucial for the safety evaluation of structures built on such grounds. Several numerical tools and methodologies have been proposed in the literature to model the site response of liquefiable deposits, including centrifuge testing and numerical analysis using finite element methods. In this summary, we will review three recent studies that use OpenSees, a popular finite element software, to model the site response of liquefiable deposits.\n\nRamirez et al. (2018) conducted a centrifuge experimental study to evaluate the effectiveness of different numerical tools and methodologies for modeling site response in liquefiable deposits. They used a 3D effective stress model in OpenSees (SSPbrickUP) to model the centrifuge liquefaction experiment. The study showed that the selected numerical tools and methodologies were able to accurately predict the site response of the liquefiable deposit.\n\nGobbi et al. (2017) used a 2D OpenSees model to analyze the soil liquefaction-induced failure of embankments. They applied a simple SDOF structure on top of a liquefiable deposit and studied the effect of different boundary conditions on the embankment's response. The study showed that the use of appropriate boundary conditions can significantly affect the embankment's response to liquefaction.\n\nKarimi and Dashti (2016) compared the results of a 3D OpenSees effective stress model with centrifuge modeling of seismic soil-foundation-structure interaction on liquefiable ground. They found that the numerical model was able to accurately predict the centrifuge results, highlighting the potential of numerical methods for evaluating the site response of liquefiable deposits.\n\nZhang et al. (2003) treated seismic input and boundary conditions in a nonlinear seismic analysis of a bridge ground system using OpenSees. They used a 2D soil-structure interaction model of the full bridge system and studied the effect of different boundary conditions on the system's response. The study showed that the use of appropriate boundary conditions can significantly affect the bridge's response to seismic loads.\n\nElgamal et al. (2008) conducted a three-dimensional seismic response analysis of the Humboldt Bay Bridge-Foundation-Ground system using OpenSees. They used lateral boundaries connected with equal DOF and applied force input individually to each base node. The study showed that the numerical model was able to accurately predict the bridge's response to seismic loads.\n\nIn conclusion, these studies demonstrate the potential of OpenSees for modeling the site response of liquefiable deposits and the effectiveness of different numerical tools and methodologies for evaluating the response of these deposits. Future studies should continue to explore the capabilities and limitations of OpenSees for this application, particularly in the context of centrifuge testing and other experimental methods.\n\nReferences:\n\nElgamal, A.

   "answer": " Numerical modeling of soil liquefaction and its effects on structures has become an important research area in geotechnical engineering. Researchers have employed various numerical tools and methodologies to simulate the behavior of soil and structures under different conditions. In this summary, we will focus on the use of OpenSees, a popular open-source software for nonlinear dynamic analysis of structures and soil-structure systems, in modeling liquefaction-induced failure of embankments and bridges.\n\nRamirez et al. (2018) used OpenSees to evaluate different numerical tools and methodologies for modeling centrifuge liquefaction experiments. They developed a 3D effective stress site response model in OpenSees (SSPbrickUP) with shear beam boundary conditions (equalDOF on sides and base) to simulate the behavior of a layered liquefiable deposit. The study demonstrated the importance of accurately modeling the soil's behavior and the influence of boundary conditions on the results.\n\nGobbi et al. (2017) used OpenSees to model the numerical analysis of soil liquefaction-induced failure of embankments. They developed a 2D OpenSees model of an embankment with base fixed in Y, periodic lateral boundaries, and a single dashpot used to apply input force. The study showed that the numerical model was able to capture the main features of liquefaction-induced failure and highlighted the importance of considering the effects of soil liquefaction in embankment design.\n\nKarimi and Dashti (2016) compared numerical and centrifuge modeling of seismic soil-foundation-structure interaction on liquefiable ground using OpenSees. They developed a 3D OpenSees effective stress model with a simple SDOF structure on top and compared it with centrifuge experiments. The study demonstrated the ability of OpenSees to capture the behavior of soil-structure systems under seismic loading and the importance of considering soil liquefaction in such analyses.\n\nZhang et al. (2003) used OpenSees to model seismic soil-foundation-structure interaction in a bridge ground system. They developed a 2D Soil-structure interaction model of a full bridge system in OpenSees with equalDOF on sides and base tied together in the first iteration and absorbent boundaries on sides and individual dashpots and force input on base nodes in the second iteration. The study highlighted the importance of accurately modeling the soil-structure interaction and the effects of soil liquefaction in bridge design.\n\nElgamal et al. (2008) modeled the three-dimensional seismic response of the Humboldt Bay Bridge-Foundation-Ground System using OpenSees. They developed a 3D OpenSees model with lateral boundaries connected with equalDOF and base nodes each having a 3D dashpot connected and input applied individually as force to each node. The study demonstrated the ability of OpenSees to capture the complex behavior of soil-structure systems under seismic loading and the importance of considering three-dimensional effects in such analyses.\n\nIn summary, OpenSees has been widely used in recent years to model and analyze soil liquefaction and its effects on structures. The software's ability to model complex soil behavior and soil-structure interaction has made it a powerful tool for researchers and engineers working in this field. Accurate modeling of soil liquefaction and its effects is essential for the design and analysis of structures built on liquefiable soil, and OpenSees has proven to be a valuable tool in this regard.\n\nReferences:\n\nRamirez, G., Fuenzalida, R., & Lopez-Cozar, E.

Women are central to humanitarian operations around the world. This decision could be devastating for the Afghan people.\n    — Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) December 24, 2022\n\nThe European Union – a major funder of aid organisations working in Afghanistan – condemned the decision and said it was assessing “the impact it will have on our aid on the ground”.\n\nThis latest attack on women’s rights and freedoms comes days after the administration ordered universities to close to women.\n\nThe move prompted international condemnation. This week foreign ministers from the G7 called on the Taliban to lift the ban, warning that “gender persecution may amount to a crime against humanity”.\n\nHowever, the Afghan minister of higher education defended the ban. Nida Mohammad Nadim said the it would prevent men and women mixing at universities and he believed some subjects being taught violated the principles of Islam.\n\n“We told girls to have proper hijab but they didn’t and they wore dresses like they are going to a wedding ceremony,” he said. “Girls were studying agriculture and engineering, but this didn’t match Afghan culture. Girls should learn, but not in areas that go against Islam and Afghan honour.”\n\nHe said universities would reopen for women once these issues, which he said were being worked on, were resolved.\n\nHowever, this echoes the Taliban’s promises about secondary school access for girls, which was banned last year.\n\nIt had insisted classes would resume for girls once “technical issues” concerning uniforms and transport were sorted out. However the ban remains in place.\n\nThe Taliban has also banned girls and all female staff including teachers from primary schools meaning there is now in effect a total ban on education for women in the country.",

This latest move will further curtail women's freedoms and participation in society. The order from the economy ministry claims the reason is some women not adhering to the Taliban's conservative dress code. \n\nThis ban on women staff could have devastating effects and disrupt vital humanitarian aid operations. NGOs have warned that a large portion of their employees in remote parts of Afghanistan are women, and women are critical to ensuring other women and girls can access support. One international NGO involved in food distribution said this ban will be a \"big blow\" as they rely on women staff to understand and address the needs of Afghan women. It remains unclear if the order also applies to foreign women working for these organizations.\n\nThe international community has condemned this ban, with the US Secretary of State calling it \"devastating\" as it will disrupt assistance to millions amid Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis. The EU also criticized the decision, noting they will have to assess the impact on their aid operations in the country. This latest move to restrict women's roles comes just days after the Taliban banned women from attending universities, drawing widespread condemnation from abroad. \n\nBy barring women from working and education, the Taliban is further marginalizing and othering Afghan women from society. However, their restrictive policies also risk undermining vital aid efforts that bridge communities and ensure all Afghans can access basic services. The international community continues calling on the Taliban to respect women's rights and lift discriminatory bans, though the administration seems intent on curtailing women's freedoms and belonging within the norms of their extreme interpretation of Islam."

Many have expressed concerns that the ban will disrupt vital and life-saving assistance to millions of people in need. The ban on women employees is particularly alarming as female personnel are critical to ensuring that women can access support, such as healthcare and education.\n\nThe Taliban's actions can be seen as an attempt to other women and exclude them from participating in important parts of Afghan society. This move can be viewed as a violation of women's basic human rights, including the right to work and education.\n\nThe ban also highlights the Taliban's efforts to consolidate power and control over the country. By restricting women's access to work and education, the Taliban is sending a clear message that they will not tolerate dissent or challenge to their authority.\n\nThis latest attack on women's rights and freedoms comes days after the Taliban ordered universities to close to women. The Taliban's actions demonstrate a pattern of exclusion and discrimination against women in Afghanistan.\n\nDespite this setback, it is important to remember that women in Afghanistan continue to play a critical role in the country's future.

The ban is seen as a significant setback for women's rights and freedoms in the country, as female personnel are critical to ensuring that women can access support and assistance. The move has been met with international condemnation, with the United States and European Union expressing concern over the impact it will have on vital aid operations.\n\nThe ban comes days after the Taliban ordered universities to close to women, and it appears to be part of a broader pattern of the administration's efforts to restrict women's rights and freedoms. The administration has cited concerns over women's dress and mixing with men as the reason for the ban, but critics argue that these are simply pretexts for a more fundamental attack on women's rights.\n\nThe impact of the ban on aid organizations is significant, as female personnel are often the only ones able to reach and assist women in remote areas of the country. The International Rescue Committee has stated that its over 3,000 female staff in Afghanistan are \"critical for the delivery of humanitarian assistance,\" and an official at an international NGO involved in food distribution has noted that the ban will \"disrupt vital and life-saving assistance to millions.\"\n\nThe ban has also sparked concerns over the fate of female students, as the Taliban has banned girls and all female staff, including teachers, from primary schools, effectively resulting in a total ban on education for women in the country.\n\nThe article highlights the concept of othering, where the Taliban administration is portraying women as \"other\" and distinct from men, and is thereby justifying their restrictions on women's rights and freedoms. The administration's claims that women are not adhering to Islamic dress code and are mixing with men in universities are seen as a way to justify the ban, rather than addressing the real issues faced by women in the country.\n\nFurthermore, the ban on women's education is a significant violation of the right to education, which is recognized as a fundamental human right under international law. The Taliban's actions are seen as a form of gender persecution, which may amount to a crime against humanity, as stated by foreign ministers from the G7.\n\nIn conclusion, the ban on female employees of NGOs in Afghanistan is a significant setback for women's rights and freedoms in the country. The move is seen as a form of othering, where the Taliban administration is portraying women as \"other\" and distinct from men, and is thereby justifying their restrictions on women's rights and freedoms. The ban has significant consequences for aid organizations, as well as for female students, who are now effectively banned from education in the country. The international community has condemned the ban, and it is important that the Taliban administration is held accountable for their actions."

They justify this by citing non-compliance with their interpretation of Islamic dress code, creating a divide based on gender. This portrayal of women as different and inferior further reinforces biases against them.\n\n**Bridging:**\n\nThe ban hinders communication and understanding between women and aid organizations, as female employees are the primary contact for addressing women's concerns. This disconnection isolates women, depriving them of access to critical support and information.\n\n**Belonging:**\n\nThe directive undermines women's sense of belonging within the workforce and society. By excluding them from humanitarian organizations, the Taliban essentially erases their contributions and downplays the significance of their role. This sends a message that women do not belong in spaces where they can make a difference.\n\nThe decision has garnered international condemnation, with the U.S., the European Union, and the G7 calling for the ban to be lifted. Aid organizations have expressed concerns that the ban will hinder their ability to deliver life-saving assistance to millions of Afghans, particularly women and children. The Taliban's actions continue a pattern of repression against women's rights and freedoms, highlighting the urgent need to address gender equality and inclusion in Afghanistan."

Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.\n\nMay 20, 2023, 9:58 PM UTC\nShare this story\n\n\n\nAn illustration of the Neeva browser running on a mobile phone.\nNeeva tried to build a different kind of search engine — but couldn’t make the business work. Image: Neeva\nNeeva, which for a while looked like one of the startups with a real chance to challenge the supremacy of Google Search, announced on Saturday that it is shutting down its search engine. The company says it’s pivoting to AI — and may be acquired by Snowflake, The Information reported — but mostly seems to believe it failed.\n\n“Building search engines is hard,” Neeva co-founders Sridhar Ramaswamy and Vivek Raghunathan wrote in a blog post announcing the shutdown. (Ramaswamy in particular is part of the reason Neeva seemed promising — as the longtime head of Google’s ad business, few people are better equipped to know how to build and monetize search than he is.) But Neeva did it, they said. It built a good, competitive search engine. It was actually well ahead of Google in some respects, like swapping 10 blue links for a more visual page and emphasizing human-created information.\n\nBut building the search engine was actually the easy part. “Throughout this journey, we’ve discovered that it is one thing to build a search engine, and an entirely different thing to convince regular users of the need to switch to a better choice,” Ramaswamy and Raghunathan continued.\n\nBuilding the search engine was actually the easy part\n\nI’ve talked with Neeva’s co-founders several times over the last couple of years, and their list of grievances here is long and well-founded. They’ve had to contend with the billion-dollar deals Google signs to make itself the default search engine on devices everywhere; the huge “are you sure you want to change?” popups that show up whenever you try to set a new default browser or search engine; the difficulty of finding those settings in the first place; the mess that is the Chrome Web Store; on and on and on. Anyone trying to build a new search engine is fighting a massively uphill battle.\n\nNeeva was also a paid product, as the company tried to prove a business model for search other than ads and surveillance. “Contrary to popular belief,” the co-founders wrote in the blog post, “convincing users to pay for a better experience was actually a less difficult problem compared to getting them to try a new search engine in the first place.” Combine that with a tough economy, and Neeva simply couldn’t see a business path forward.\n\nThe timing here is really interesting. Neeva is shutting down at what might be the best moment in two decades for upstart search engines. Users are increasingly fed up with the ad load and subpar results they get from Google, and AI chatbots like Bing and ChatGPT have upended everyone’s idea about how to interact with the internet. Neeva bet on this, too, developing a large language model-based system called Neeva AI that is in many ways more useful than what you’ll get from Bing or Bard. But that wasn’t enough either.\n\nThe race to take down Google is still very much on, of course: Bing continues to push hard to gain market share, and Brave recently touted that it now runs completely on its own search stack. Companies like you.com and DuckDuckGo are also trying to re-think the way search works, and using AI to do so.

You already know how to concatenate two string values together with a plus operator but Python can do much more than that. Let's take a look at some of the ways Python lets you write print and access strings in your code. Toping string values in Python code is fairly straightforward. They begin and end with a single quote. But then how can you use a single quote that's inside of a string. For example we have the string that is Alice's cat. This doesn't work because Python thinks that the string ends after Alice because of this quote and that the rest this s cat is just invalid Python code. Fortunately there are multiple ways to type strings. Strings can begin and end with double quotes just as they do with single quotes. That is Alice's cat. One benefit of using double quotes that a string can have a single quote character in it. Since the string begins with a double quote Python is smart enough to know that a single quote is just part of the string and it's not indicating the end of the string. However if you need to use both single quotes and double quotes inside of a string you'll need to use escape characters in escape character lets you use characters that are otherwise impossible to put into a string escape character consists of a backslash followed by a letter that represents which escape character you want to add to the string. For example the escape character for a single quote is backslash quote so I could have a string say hi to Bob's mother. Python knows that since this single quote has a backslash before it. This is not a single quote meant to end the string value. Instead it's saying put a literal single quote as part of the string table 6 Dash 1 in the automake book shows the different types of escape characters you'll use. You can have them for single quotes double quotes if you want have a tab or multiple spaces entered into your text or if you want to have a new line similar to hitting the enter key. Or if you want to have a backslash itself you can just have slash slash. So it's trail that newline character. Here I'm just going to have something else to print Hello there and then slash in for a newline character . Are you another new line. And then I'm fine escaping that single quote and this so we can have a single print statement. Print out text across multiple lines. Now if you have text that includes many backslashes that you don't want seen as the beginning of an escape character you can use a raw string in Python a raw string is the exact same as a normal string except it begins with a lowercase are right before. So this is a valid Python string so we can have something like that is Karel's cat. And because this is a raw string this is literally interpreted as part of the string. You can see when it's printed out as a string value. Python automatically adds that here let's try copying and pasting this into the print function call and you can see right now because this is a raw string. The backslashes are literally a part of the string. All strings are helpful if you're typing a string value that contains many backslashes and this comes up in our lesson in the future about regular expressions. Now while you can use slash in to put a new line into a string it's often easier to just use multiline strings. A multi long string in Python begins and ends with either 3 single quote characters or three double quote characters. So any quotes tabs or new lines in between the triple quotes are considered part of the string so I could have something like. Print. Begin a new multi line. Dear Alice heaves. Cat has been arrested for catnapping cat burglary and extortion. Sincerely Bob. And and that multi-line string no notice. I'm kind of breaking the rules of having one instruction per line right here. Python's smart enough to realize that. OK this is all one quote unquote line of code. This is just one function call doesn't matter that it's being split across multiple lines. I'm not creating any new blocks or anything like that Python smart enough to know. OK until I see another triple quotes. Everything here is part of the string including all the new lines. So if we stored this string into a variable like spam and we just wanted to display the string content inside span Python would automatically format it using the slash Hinz. So triple quotes are really handy if you have some gigantic string. So I'm going to create a new file editor window and say when to copy and paste the entire text to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet which I happen to have right here in this text file. I can just hit Control ate slept all and Control-C to copy and then control V to paste it. And now any backslashes or single quotes or new lines that are inside. All of this text are just automatically seen as part of the string. It's really unlikely that there's going to be a triple double quotes inside of the string and if there if there are I can just use the triple single quotes instead. I we just end this so all of this is just one giant variable assignment for the span variable. And I can just treat that string just like any other string I could print it out. That's going to be a lot of output though. Let's just print out with the length of this string is just to see roughly how many characters are in it. I'll save this as example that pi and press 5 to run it. OK so that has 174 thousand letters in it. Strings use indexes and slices the same way. List do you can think of a string like hello world as kind of like a list like value with each character being an item in that list. So we had something like spam equals Hello world. I could do all the same things with strings that I do with lists so I can use indexes to pick out a single letter from it. I could use slices to pick out some substring from it I can use the negative indexes to get the very last character the in and not in operators. Also work with it. So hello in spam would evaluate to true. Since this text does exist inside that string and see if the letter X appears in that string it doesn't. So this evaluates to false. And note that this is case sensitive. So if I look for capital hello inside that string or turn false. To recap strings can begin and end with double quotes just as they do single quotes ASCII characters let you put quotes and other characters that are hard to type inside your string code. Raw strings will literally print any backslashes in the string and ignore escape characters multi-line strings begin and end with triple quotes and they can span multiple lines indexes slices the in and not in operators all work with strings just as they do with list\"\n\n\nexample: ",

However, there has been a lack of new drugs for decades and bacteria are becoming harder to treat, as they evolve resistance to the ones we have.\n\nMore than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that resist treatment with antibiotics.\n\nThe researchers focused on one of the most problematic species of bacteria - Acinetobacter baumannii, which can infect wounds and cause pneumonia.\n\nYou may not have heard of it, but it is one of the three superbugs the World Health Organization has identified as a \"critical\" threat.\n\nIt is often able to shrug off multiple antibiotics and is a problem in hospitals and care homes, where it can survive on surfaces and medical equipment.\n\nDr Jonathan Stokes, from McMaster University, describes the bug as \"public enemy number one\" as it's \"really common\" to find cases where it is \"resistant to nearly every antibiotic\".\n\nDr Jonathan Stokes\nIMAGE SOURCE,MCMASTER UNIVERSITY\nImage caption,\nDr Jonathan Stokes\nArtificial intelligence\nTo find a new antibiotic, the researchers first had to train the AI. They took thousands of drugs where the precise chemical structure was known, and manually tested them on Acinetobacter baumannii to see which could slow it down or kill it.\n\nThis information was fed into the AI so it could learn the chemical features of drugs that could attack the problematic bacterium.\n\nThe AI was then unleashed on a list of 6,680 compounds whose effectiveness was unknown. The results - published in Nature Chemical Biology - showed it took the AI an hour and a half to produce a shortlist.\n\nThe researchers tested 240 in the laboratory, and found nine potential antibiotics. One of them was the incredibly potent antibiotic abaucin.\n\nLaboratory experiments showed it could treat infected wounds in mice and was able to kill A. baumannii samples from patients.\n\nHowever, Dr Stokes told me: \"This is when the work starts.\"\n\nThe next step is to perfect the drug in the laboratory and then perform clinical trials.

The company has conducted extensive research on animals, with successful results, and now aims to bring this revolutionary technology to humans.\n\nMusk envisions that Neuralink’s brain implants could help cure various conditions, such as obesity, autism, depression, and schizophrenia, as well as enable web browsing and telepathy.\n\nThe entrepreneur believes so strongly in the safety of the devices that he has even expressed his willingness to have them implanted in his children.\n\nFDA Approval: A Critical Milestone\nThe FDA’s approval marks a significant step forward for Neuralink, which has been seeking the agency’s consent since 2019.\n\nDespite some previous setbacks, including the rejection of the company’s application in early 2022, the FDA has now given the green light for Neuralink to proceed with its first human clinical trials.\n\nAlthough the specific aims and details of the study have not been disclosed, Neuralink has stated that it is not yet recruiting participants and that more information will be available soon.\n\nHow Neuralink’s Brain Implant Technology Works\nNeuralink’s system operates by using a sewing machine-like robot to surgically insert a microchip inside the brain. The robot removes a small portion of the skull, connects thread-like electrodes to target regions of the brain, and stitches up the hole, leaving only a scar.\n\n\nImage Credits: Neuralink\nThe microchip then interprets brain signals and relays information to computers via Bluetooth.\n\nAccording to Musk, the entire procedure takes just 30 minutes, does not require anesthesia, and allows patients to be discharged on the same day.\n\nNeuralink’s Success in Animal Trials\nNeuralink has demonstrated the effectiveness of its brain-implant technology in animals, most notably in a monkey that was able to play the game Pong using only its brain.\n\nThis breakthrough showcases the potential applications of Neuralink’s technology in humans and the possibilities for enhancing human capabilities.\n\nNeuralink’s Concerns in Animal Trials\nThe company’s animal-testing operations have sparked significant concern, as records reviewed by Reuters and sources with direct knowledge of the matter indicate that the company has killed approximately 1,500 animals, including over 280 sheep, pigs, and monkeys, as part of experiments conducted since 2018.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the exact number of animals tested and killed remains somewhat uncertain, as the company does not maintain precise records in this regard.\n\nCompetitors in the Brain-Implant Field\nNeuralink is not the only company working on brain-computer interfaces. Synchron and Blackrock Neurotech have already implanted devices in at least 42 people globally for clinical trials.\n\nSynchron received FDA approval in July 2021 and has successfully tested its device on four patients in Australia, who were able to send text messages using only their minds.\n\nBlackrock Neurotech obtained FDA clearance in November 2021, with its MoveAgain system enabling doctors to pick up neurological signals from the brains of paralyzed patients, allowing them to control digital devices, prosthetics, and their own limbs.\n\nChallenges and Considerations\nWhile the FDA’s approval is a significant milestone for Neuralink, it does not guarantee regulatory or commercial success. The company, along with its competitors, will need to demonstrate that its devices are safe, reliable, and effective, in addition to addressing the ethical and security concerns surrounding the technology.\n\nNeuralink has been the subject of several federal investigations, including probes by the Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Office of Inspector General. These investigations have focused on concerns related to animal testing and the transportation of dangerous pathogens, among other issues.\n\nDespite these challenges, Neuralink’s FDA approval for human clinical trials is a testament to the company’s persistence and progress in the field of brain-computer interfaces.\n\nImplications for the Medical Industry\nNeuralink’s technology has far-reaching implications for the medical industry, with the potential to revolutionize the treatment of various neurological conditions and disabilities. As the company moves forward with its human clinical trials, the scientific community and medical professionals will closely monitor its progress and the potential applications of its brain-implant technology.\n\nThe Future of Neuralink’s Technology\nWith the FDA’s approval, Neuralink can now begin clinical trials in humans. Although the timeline for these trials remains unclear, the company’s progress in the brain-computer interface field is undeniable.\n\nAs Musk continues to expand his business empire, which includes ventures in electric cars, rockets, artificial intelligence, and social media, Neuralink’s technology holds the potential to transform the lives of millions of people by restoring function to those with paralysis and debilitating conditions, as well as enhancing human performance.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please consider following me on Medium.

This changed in 312 AD when Constantine had a vision and converted to the Christian faith. As the new state religion, Christianity subsumed the framework of the cult of the sun god Sol Invictus.\n\nTim Brinkhof\nCopy a link to the article entitled\nShare Sol Invictus: The pagan Sun god that helped Christianity conquer the Roman Empire on Facebook\nShare Sol Invictus: The pagan Sun god that helped Christianity conquer the Roman Empire on Twitter\nShare Sol Invictus: The pagan Sun god that helped Christianity conquer the Roman Empire on LinkedIn\nThe crash course version of ancient history holds that the Roman Empire abandoned its old gods after Constantine the Great received a vision during an important military campaign. The night before a pivotal battle against his rival, Maxentius, Constantine was told in a dream to “mark the heavenly sign of God” on his soldiers’ shields to ensure victory. He obeyed and defeated Maxentius. Out of gratitude for the higher power that came to his aid, he turned Christianity from a persecuted sect into the Empire’s official religion.\n\nThere might be some truth to this narrative, but in reality, Rome’s transition from polytheism to monotheism was more complicated. Informed by new archeological excavations, modern-day historians credit other, lesser-known cults with paving the way for Christianity’s takeover — a development so drastic that there must have been some preexisting framework for Christianity to latch onto. At the center of this framework, historians argue, is Sol Invictus, a Sabine-Arab Sun god whose role in Roman society was eventually supplanted by Jesus Christ.\n\nThe origins of Sol Invictus\nRoman history knows two Sols. Worship of the first, Sol Indiges, was limited to the Eternal City itself. A god of agriculture, their first temple — located on the Quirinal Hill — is said to have been built by the Sabine king Tatius, the legendary rival-turned-ally of Rome’s equally legendary founder, Romulus. The cult of Sol Indiges survived into the Republican and early imperial periods. Augustus constructed temples for them. Vespasian converted a giant statue of Nero into the god by adding a crown. Commodus, the son of Marcus Aurelius, added Sol’s name to his own.\n\nA wall mural featuring Dionysos with Helios and Aphrodite.\nSun worship was everywhere in the Roman Empire. (Credit: ArchaiOptix / Wikimedia Commons)\nAs the borders of the Empire expanded, the Eternal City became a melting pot of different cultures. Italian traditions mingled with those of Africa and Asia Minor, and Sol Indiges combined with an eastern Sun deity to become Sol Invictus, the “Unconquered Sun.” During the third century AD, this second Sol gradually evolved from a god into the god of Rome. The emperor Elagabalus, who was raised in Syria, placed every god worshipped within Rome, including Jupiter, under the umbrella of the Sun god — one of many provocations that would anger the Roman elites and eventually led to his assassination at the hands of the Praetorian Guard.\n\nAlthough the legacy of Elagabalus was erased by his immediate successors, the cult of Sol Invictus bounced back under Aurelian, who reunited the Empire after it split into three sub-empires. Like successful emperors before him, Aurelian fancied himself the instrument and, at times, embodiment of a higher power. In his case: Sol Invictus. While Aurelian’s connection to Sol is unclear — it has been said that his mother was a priestess — the consequences of his connection are apparent. As argued by Gaston Halsberghe and others, Aurelian’s elevation of the cult helped reforge a fractured empire.\n\nLight and fire\nThe transition from Sol Invictus to Jesus Christ is best documented in archeological finds. In 1953, researchers began digging underneath St. Peter’s Basilica, built under Constantine, in hope of finding its namesake’s tomb. Although they didn’t find St. Peter, they did stumble across the bodies of various pagans and Christians. In particular, one Christian tomb was decorated with a mosaic that portrayed Christ as Sol Invictus encircled by a rayed nimbus and riding a chariot. Identification with the Sun god may also be preserved in Biblical passages describing Christ and God in relation to light and fire.\n\nA close up of a mosaic on a wall showing Jesus Christ as Sol Invictus.\nThe mosaic depicting Christ as Sol Invictus from the necropolis under St. Peter’s Basilica. (Credit: Wikimedia Commons)\nEven Christmas can be traced back to the cult of Sol. In contrast to the festive Romans, the death-oriented Christians didn’t celebrate birthdays, especially not for gods. “We men gather our vintages, and they think and believe that the gods gather and bring in their grapes,” wrote Arnobius, a Christian apologist from the third century. “We have birthdays, and they affirm that the powers of heaven have birthdays.” Most early Christians didn’t discuss the birth of Christ. Those who did made no reference to the date or offered conflicting dates.\n\nHistorians link the advent of Christianity to Sol Invictus partly because December 25 marked the so-called Feast of the Unconquered Sun before it became officially recognized as the birthday of Christ. The cult of Sol originally started holding the Feast on December 25 because it coincided with the winter solstice, the time of year when daylight starts to lengthen again. Theologians settled on the date not just because of the solstice. December 25 was also exactly nine months removed from what they deemed the anniversary of creation, giving the Messiah’s life a regularity befitting of his divine nature.\n\nRome reborn\nRome’s transition from polytheism to monotheism isn’t about Christianity replacing the cult of Sol Invictus so much as it is about non-Christian Romans accepting Christ as the replacement for the Sun god. Historians still struggle to understand how and why the Empire appropriated a religion it had brutally persecuted for so long. Similarities between the character of Christ and Sol Invictus — such as their mutual association with light and the heavens — constitute one piece of this unsolved puzzle, as does overlap between the practices and rituals of their respective followers.\n\nA painting of a Constantine the Great praying.\nConstantine the Great’s visions of the cross as depicted by the Baroque painter Theodoor Boeyermans. (Credit: magnoliabox / Wikimedia Commons)\nSome historians place emphasis on the role played by Constantine. Following his vision-verified victory, life became increasingly difficult for subjects who did not follow him into conversion. For example, Constantine’s trust in and promotion of Christians within his bureaucracy made joining the religion a prerequisite for a career in government or the military. As the Empire’s most powerful citizens converted, so did those under their command. Before long, Christianity had spread from Asia Minor to the shores of Spain.\n\nIndicative of Rome’s pluralism, Constantine continued worshipping Sol Invictus even after he converted to Christianity. It was not until 323 AD, more than a decade after he received word from God, that he publicly renounced the Unconquered Sun in favor of the crucified Son. The same year that the Sun disappeared from the emperor’s life, solar symbols disappeared from Roman coins.

    "content": "General Discussion\nDuring communication, speakers produce visual cues signaling their confidence level in the content of their speech, which can reflect their word retrieval (Goodwin and Goodwin, 1986; Rimé and Schiaratura, 1991; Krauss et al., 1996) and/or their (un)conscious desire to communicate their mental state to others (Goodwin and Goodwin, 1986; Visser et al., 2014). However, it is unknown if observers use the visual cues from these cognitive and social processes when perceiving a speaker's confidence level. There is a lack of research investigating whether there is a difference between the types of visual cues speakers produce because of their transient confidence level and the types of visual cues observers use to assess this mental state. This study tested this issue in relation to a speaker's confidence for general knowledge facts by observers indicating the visual cues they used after evaluating a speaker's confidence level.\n\n\nEffect of Situational Factors on Visual Cue Production and Evaluation\nCompared to previous studies that report the occurrence of visual cues in relation to a speaker's confidence level, our results shed light on the frequency of these visual cues that speakers produce, and consequently their effect on observers' confidence evaluations. Overall, we found that speakers do not often produce changes in eye gaze, facial expressions and postural shifts, but when salient changes in these cues are produced, they can impact observers' evaluations. We postulate that one reason for this low frequency production of visual cues is due to the stakes level of social evaluation created by our experiment. A situation involving high-stakes social evaluation occurs when an individual (or group) has significant power to impact another's future (Gifford et al., 1985; Cuddy et al., 2012) such as in a job interview. Here, a speaker's speech content and their confidence level in this content, through vocal and visual cues, can greatly impact the outcome of their social interaction. In contrast, a situation of low-stakes social evaluation does not pose a risk to a speaker's social status. For example, a speaker may mundanely report inaccurate information due to inaccurately recalling (highly or less accessible) information and they will not face major social consequences for this (Depaulo et al., 1996; Gozna et al., 2001; Azizli et al., 2016). Our trivia question task may have simulated a situation of low-stakes social evaluation, in that if speakers answered a question incorrectly it did not have negative social consequences for them or their interaction with the examiner. The speakers did not know the examiner, the accuracy of their responses was not important for their social status, pausing due to word retrieval difficulties could occur because there was low social demand to respond quickly, and the questions were not used to elicit an emotional state in the speakers. This low-stakes context may explain why the speakers did not often produce postural shifts or happy, amused or embarrassed facial expressions based on their confidence level, as these cues are more often associated with situations involving social judgments and affect (Costa et al., 2001; Coleman and Wu, 2006; Hareli and Parkinson, 2008). Alternatively, the low frequency of embarrassed or amused facial expressions may have been related to the few instances where speakers answered questions about well-known general knowledge incorrectly (Table 1). Future research may explore the effect of shared knowledge that is known by the audience/observer on the visual cues that speakers produce and the visual cues that observers subsequently attend to. For example, if an observer knows the information that a speaker is trying to recall, or a speaker has difficulty recalling information that is well-known knowledge to an observer or audience; how do these situations affect a speaker's perceived confidence and the cues that observers attend to. This question may be addressed by examining the interaction between a speaker's visual and vocal cues on their perceived confidence.\n\n\nThis low-stakes context may also explain the small difference in speakers' perceived confidence ratings for high vs. low confidence. Since speakers were in a situation of low social stress, the quantity and types of visual cues they produced to indicate high vs. low confidence in their speech content, may have been less differentiated to observers. Future research may explore how the level of social evaluation in a given context can impact speaker's memory retrieval and visual cues as well as observers' evaluations. Nonetheless, we do not know if observers detected that speakers produced speech in a low-stakes context, and if detecting this context may have affected the types of visual cues used in their social evaluations.\n\n\nResearch on a speaker's transient confidence level based on their speech content has largely tested speakers' level of certainty for general knowledge facts (Smith and Clark, 1993; Brennan and Williams, 1995; Swerts and Krahmer, 2005). More research is needed to understand the impact of speakers' transient confidence level for other information, such as their opinions. This is particularly relevant when speakers are trying to persuade an audience of their stance, as the speech content may also elicit a greater emotional valence compared to responding to general knowledge questions. Here, speakers' responses, including their visual cues, are more likely to be socially evaluated by others such as an employer conducting a job interview (DeGroot and Motowidlo, 1999), a person on a date (Muehlenhard et al., 1986; Fichten et al., 1992; Ambady and Skowronski, 2008), a judge in court (Cramer et al., 2009), a customer interacting with a salesperson (Leigh and Summers, 2002), or a border security officer. Future research should explore this branch of a speaker's confidence in their speech content with greater consideration for situational factors. In these contexts, speakers may (un)consciously produce visual cues to save face (Goffman, 1967, 1971; Visser et al., 2014) or reinforce their level of certainty (Moons et al., 2013), and observers' evaluations of a speaker's confidence level via their non-verbal cues can have real social implications.\n\n\nLimitations and Conclusions\nOne limitation of our study was our inter-rater reliability for the subcategories of visual cues speakers produced. Though the inter-rater agreement between the coders was significantly greater than chance, the coefficients did not indicate strong agreement. Thus, the detection of a speaker's visual cues may require more training as individuals can vary in their conceptualization of and identification for visual cues. Also, a speaker's production of eye movements to signal their confidence level may be influenced by their cultural background, in accordance with cultural display rules in the eyes and facial expressions (McCarthy et al., 2006, 2008). Our results were based on native speakers of Canadian English with various cultural backgrounds; controlling for this factor could help explain some of the variability between the speakers in the quantity and types of visual cues produced. Moreover, examining the effect of observers' cultural attitudes based on a speaker's physical appearance would also allow us to examine other types of social factors that may have influenced observers' confidence evaluations of speakers and whether the types of visual cues that observers used in their evaluations differed based on a speaker's physical appearance. Also, having a larger sample of speakers would allow us to increase the generalizability of our findings. Lastly, our study operated under the assumption that when observers only have access to the visual communication channel, they can accurately recall what visual cues they used in their evaluation of a speaker's confidence. It may be argued that this manipulation created an unnatural context to evaluate a speaker's confidence level, since in everyday communication observers have access to many communication channels and can assess a speaker's mental state in real time. On the other hand, there are also real-life contexts where observers have heightened attention for/use of the visual communication channel, such as interacting with speakers of a foreign or second language (Sueyoshi and Hardison, 2005) or listening to speech in a noisy environment (Neely, 1956). Use of an eye-tracking paradigm could provide an objective, real-time measure of the visual cues that observers used in their confidence evaluations. Nonetheless, observers rarely reported they did not know which visual cues they used in their evaluations. This result may indicate that when observers only have access to the visual communication channel, they are to some extent, aware of the visual cues they perceive.\n\n\nIn conclusion, this study showed that observers can accurately perceive a speaker's confidence level in the content of their speech in a low-stakes context based on their visual cues, by primarily using the speaker's facial expressions and eye movements. Observers may be socially attuned to salient, yet infrequent cues in the facial regions so they can efficiently infer a speaker's confidence level in the speech content. This social attention may be important as the stakes of the situation increase for speakers. Future research should explore using more video recordings of speakers' spontaneous speech and examining variability across speakers, to improve descriptions of the visual cues that speakers produce signaling their confidence level in the speech content. These methodological changes will better reflect the cues that aid in observers' assessments of a speaker's confidence level and their communicative interactions with others.\n\n\n\n\nsummarize all that in conclusions firstly and then in points of subjects with its explanation included in the study\nin very informative and all inclusive",

   "answer": "## Conclusions:\n\nThis study demonstrates that observers can accurately gauge a speaker's confidence level based solely on visual cues, primarily facial expressions and eye movements, even in low-stakes situations. This suggests a social attunement to subtle yet significant visual cues, particularly in the facial region, allowing for efficient inference of a speaker's confidence.  However, the study also highlights the infrequency of these visual cues in low-stakes scenarios, possibly due to the lack of social pressure. Future research should focus on analyzing spontaneous speech and individual speaker variations to better understand the nuances of these visual cues and their impact on social interactions, particularly in higher-stakes environments.\n\n## Key Subjects and Explanations:\n\n* **Visual Cues and Confidence:** The study investigated the relationship between visual cues produced by a speaker and an observer's perception of their confidence level. It found that despite the infrequency of these cues in low-stakes settings, observers could still accurately perceive confidence levels, primarily relying on facial expressions and eye movements.\n* **Low-Stakes Context and Cue Production:** The study suggests that the low-stakes nature of the trivia task likely contributed to the infrequent production of visual cues related to confidence. This is attributed to the lack of social pressure and potential consequences for incorrect answers.\n* **Impact of Social Evaluation:** The study proposes that higher-stakes situations, where social evaluation is more significant, might lead to more pronounced and frequent visual cues related to confidence. This highlights the potential influence of social context on both cue production and observer perception.\n* **Limitations and Future Research:** The study acknowledges limitations such as inter-rater reliability for coding visual cues, cultural influences on cue production and perception, and the artificiality of restricting observers to only visual information.  Future research should address these limitations by examining spontaneous speech, individual speaker variations, and the impact of cultural factors.\n* **Real-World Applications:**  The findings have implications for understanding communication in various real-world scenarios, including job interviews, legal proceedings, and sales interactions, where perceiving a speaker's confidence can be crucial for social judgment and decision-making.\n* **Methodological Considerations:** The study highlights the need for more refined methodologies, such as eye-tracking, to objectively measure observer attention to visual cues and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics between visual cues, confidence perception, and social interaction.\n\nThis summary provides a concise overview of the study's key findings and implications, emphasizing the complex interplay between visual cues, confidence perception, and social context. It also highlights the need for continued research to further explore this fascinating area of human communication.\n"

    "answer": "Here is a synopsis of the text with analysis of its themes and morals:\n\nThis story tells of a traveling musician who uses his musical talents to rid a town of rats. However, when the town refuses to pay him as agreed, he takes revenge in a darkly poetic way. \n\nKey themes explored include keeping one's word/honoring agreements, the dangers of crossing or disrespecting someone with specialized skills, and the power of music/art. There are also themes of morality, justice, and the consequences of one's actions.\n\nAfter successfully exterminating the rats, the musician is not paid as the contract stipulated. Seeing this as a betrayal, he decides to use his musical abilities for vengeance instead of help. He lures all the townswomen to their deaths by a cliff, then commands the starving rats to invade the town and homes. \n\nThis shows the moral that one should not break agreements or take others for granted, as there may be unforeseen consequences. It also illustrates how specialized skills could potentially be misused if the skilled individual feels wronged. \n\nThe gruesome yet artistic nature of the musician's revenge highlights how the creative arts have the power both to soothe and destroy. It leaves an unsettling message about respecting an artist's talents and integrity.\n\nOverall, the dark tale serves as a cautionary fable about the importance of keeping one's word, honoring contracts, and not crossing those with unique abilities one has relied upon, lest the tables suddenly turn with tragic results. Music, meant to charm, is twisted to enact a grim form of poetic justice."

The story is set in a town infested with rats, and the rat-catcher is called upon to vanquish them. He uses his musical skills to lure the rats into a pit, and the town's people are relieved of their rat problem. However, when it comes time for him to be paid, the town's people break their promise to pay him for his services, leading to a series of events where the rat-catcher takes revenge on the town by using his music to control the rats, turning them against the people.\n\nThe themes present in the text include the consequences of broken promises, the corrupting influence of power, and the idea of just deserts. The rat-catcher is a victim of the town's people's dishonesty, and his revenge is a form of justice for the wrongs committed against him. The story also explores the idea of the corrupting influence of power, as the rat-catcher's ability to control the rats leads him to take increasingly drastic measures against the town's people.\n\nThe moral of the story is that broken promises and dishonesty have consequences, and that those who wield power must be careful not to let it corrupt them. The rat-catcher's revenge, while justified in some ways, ultimately leads to further chaos and destruction, highlighting the idea that two wrongs don't make a right. The story also highlights the importance of honesty and integrity, and the dangers of exploiting others for personal gain."

    "content": "I have a doctorate level research proposal to write. The topic is \"The Impact of Industrial Performance and benefits of Globalisation on HR in Nigeria.\". The aim is To identify the effect of globalisation through the means of world integration, inter-dependency and interrelation of performance in Nigerian business sector In recent times. The objectives are \nI.To ascertain the extent to which organisational culture is superseded by the globalised idea of human resource management among Nigerian workers and industrial firms.\nII. Examining cross-border industry collaboration as a means of organisational progress for Nigerian domestic business in the phase of globalisation.\nIII. To evaluate the benefit of globalisation for Nigerian workforce, employers, and competitiveness of productive capacity for the growth of established and up-and-coming businesses in Nigeria.\n\n\nThe rationale for the study is below:\nThe study highlights the lack of adequate literature for this evaluation by delving into the recently understudied component of performance appraisal. This business endeavour has sparked research into the enhancement of employee relations, performance evaluation of employees, and human resource management in Nigeria's industrial sectors. Based on the core concept that policies that prioritise natural and technological resources would surely be unsustainable in light of the expansion of economic activity and the diffusion of knowledge and technology, the focus on human resources management (HRM). As a result, it is asserted that there is a demand on human resources. (Schakowsky, 2002).\n\nDespite the underlying theme of perceived marginalisation in the theory, it may seem unarguable that a country like Nigeria, the most populous country of African origin with over 140 million people, would see HRM-based strategy as crucial to economic success. History and current data demonstrate that the human capital of developing countries makes a major contribution to the development of industrialised countries. (Zikmund, 1998)\n\nAlthough Kerr et al (1962a),Not many empirical studies have examined how globalisation has impacted human resource management in Nigeria, despite the fact that the value of human resources in national development is increasingly acknowledged. According to Kerr et al. (1962b), many developing nations rely on the results of studies that were conducted abroad since there aren't many empirically grounded studies on the effect of globalisation on HRM in such nations. Unfortunately, this tendency is consistent with the literature's assertion that, as a result of globalization's overwhelming effects, policy options and preferences tend to favour globalisation more than nation-specific solutions. Kerr and co. (1962c).\n\n\"The Dependency Theory\" is one of the economic theories that should be used to describe how globalisation has affected the expansion of Nigeria's industrial sector. According to the hypothesis, affluent nations would not be able to maintain their current quality of living without the markets, cheap labor, and access to natural resources that poor or emerging nations offer to them. Rich countries deliberately use a variety of tactics to maintain a dependency situation. Wilson (2012b) (2012b), This effect may be influenced by Aspects of the development of human resources include economics, media control, banking and finance, education, politics, culture, and sports.\n\nThis study sought to examine the impact of globalisation on Nigeria's human resource management. According to Vincent (2012), the underlying theoretical presumptions for this study are that globalisation is a phenomena that is here to stay and has profound influence on practically all facets of life. In light of the fact that human resources are what provide African countries—including Nigeria—a competitive edge, it makes scholarly sense to investigate the connections between the two.\n\n\n\n\nLiterature review on the study is below:\nHofstede et al. \n(1990)  and  Sagiv  &  Schwartz  (2007)  emphasize  that  organizational  culture  dimensions \nconsiderably differ from national culture dimensions. Nevertheless they are related to each other. \nSagiv & Schwartz (2007) explain that organizations operate under  pressure of societal values.\nHofstede et al. \n(1990)  and  Sagiv  &  Schwartz  (2007)  emphasize  that  organizational  culture  dimensions \nconsiderably differ from national culture dimensions. Nevertheless they are related to each other. \nSagiv & Schwartz (2007) explain that organizations operate under  pressure of societal values.\nHofstede et al. \n(1990)  and  Sagiv  &  Schwartz  (2007)  emphasize  that  organizational  culture  dimensions \nconsiderably differ from national culture dimensions. Nevertheless they are related to each other. \nSagiv & Schwartz (2007) explain that organizations operate under  pressure of societal values.\n\n8. Brief review of relevant literature (Approximately 1,000 words) with a minimum of 6 key publications should be cited. (Critically evaluate recent and relevant research that has addressed similar issues to those covered in your objectives) \n\nThe impact of Globalisation on Performance of Employees in Nigerian Industry\n Organizational performance may be examined in light of the many aspects of human resource management and workers that fuel the expansion of quickly escalating globalisation features in the Nigerian industrial sector. Scholars generally agree that globalisation and technical advancements are factors that have changed and will continue to have an impact on the social and economic systems of the many different countries. Ohamea and co. (1990). According to Pfeffer in Bernadine (2003), Traditional sources of success like speed to market of financial and technological aspects are less important than organisational culture and capabilities, which are derived from how people are managed. These more recognized sources of success can still give an advantage in the market, albeit less so than in the past.\nThe World Development Indicators (2007a) state that globalisation has given developing nations both possibilities and difficulties. Although integration into the global economy has been shown to be vital for long-term prosperity and the eradication of poverty in China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and other nations, Equal opportunity and unequal distribution of gains have drawn criticism. Globalization has been predominantly driven by the interests and needs of the industrialised world, which has access to the markets of developing countries.. However, access to developed countries' markets remains a significant challenge for developing nations, as seen by the persistent obstruction of developing nations' exports to wealthy nations by numerous tariffs and non-tariff obstacles (Obadan, 2008).\n\nWilson (2010a), as a result, In the globalised world, poor countries are in a worse negotiating position than wealthier countries. The dependence theorist additionally argued that FDI had a harmful long-term impact on the economy's growth. They argued that although FDI may hasten growth in the near term, it typically has numerous detrimental effects on it in the long run, especially in developing countries (p.10). The results of this research demonstrate that globalisation has had both beneficial and negative effects on human resource management. This runs counter to the widespread assumption among Nigerian academics that globalisation is a continuation of global imperialism and, as such, heralds only bad outcomes. Vincent (2012a).\n\nGlobalisation as a Strategic tool of Human Resource Managers in the Nigerian Industry\nAccording to Vincent (2012b),Globalization, in particular, has sped up changes to the majority of companies' HR practises and led to an upward appraisal of the pay and income structure of most Nigerian organisations. The negative effect of globalisation on HRM is that it has caused highly skilled workers to relocate abroad. Iyoha and Unugbro (2005) claim that there has been a strong correlation between globalisation and the movement and changes of various macroeconomic indicators, which demonstrate how much and how actively a country participates in the global economy. How well a country participates in the global economy can be determined by looking at the dynamics and indicators that shape the economy. The rapid growth of global trade, foreign direct investment, and according to experts.\n\nAccording to Owolabi (1998), For the purpose of gathering a network of worldwide connections to other international databases and information networks must be established for the processing, repackaging, and dissemination of information on market industry, investment, and technology. This is necessary to take advantage of opportunities in developing global markets for exports and imports, benefit from patents and technological progress to support innovation and develop new products, increase the competitive edge, and boost business.This is required to capitalise on export and import opportunities in emerging international markets, gain access to patents and technological advancements to assist innovation and the development of new goods, strengthen competitiveness, and grow the economy. Nemedia's research shows that trade liberalisation has a significant detrimental effect on the development of the industrial sector in developing nations (1998)s. Trade liberalisation, according to Nemedia's research, has a considerable negative impact on the growth of the industrial sector in emerging countries (1998). Due to slow technological growth and insufficient managerial skills, he claimed, emerging countries ran the risk of falling behind in the global economy.\n\nEconomic Benefits of Globalisation over Domestic practices of Organisational Culture in Nigeria\nAccording to Ohamea, et al. (1990), the Marxist tradition's leftist researchers have used economics as their primary theoretical framework for analysis, placing it above other social-political institutions. They contend that economics serves as the foundation from which other structures—referred to as superstructures draw their shape, significance, and function. This analytical concept seems to be pertinent to comprehending how globalisation affects numerous facets of a nation's and organization's life.\n\nThe use of human resources was the key to the success of the majority of the nations that climbed swiftly on the development ladder, according to an analysis of these nations. An excellent example is Japan. The notion that \"people are a castle\" produced the required economic miracle despite having a natural resource endowment of less than 10%. (Sano, 1998). Similar circumstances exist in Singapore. Another important lesson for developing countries, according to Soludo (2007:15), may be drawn from the growth strategies of most Asian economies, which are credited with creating the foundation for modern Singapore.\n\nAccording to Stillwell et al's (2004:595) survey, the following findings were made: 2.9% of the world's population, or about 175 million people, lived away from home for more than a year.. \n\nIn conclusion, Unskilled and semi-skilled workers are in high demand during the process due to the export of labor-intensive items and the promotion of foreign direct investment (FDI) through efficient knowledge and skill transfer. As a result, it focuses on finding solutions to novel problems for which little to no prior research has been done (Brown, 2006).Even in the worst case situation, exploratory research creates the initial research design, sample plan, and data collection method and serves as the basis for more conclusive research (Singh, 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, combine all the above write-up together and put them in not more than 500 words.

   "answer": "## The Impact of Industrial Performance and Benefits of Globalisation on HR in Nigeria\n\nThis doctoral research proposal explores the impact of globalization on human resource management (HRM) in Nigeria, focusing on the interplay of global integration, interdependence, and industrial performance. The study aims to identify the effects of globalization on the Nigerian business sector and ascertain the extent to which globalized HRM practices are superseding traditional organizational culture.  It further examines cross-border industry collaboration as a driver of organizational progress and evaluates the benefits of globalization for the Nigerian workforce, employers, and overall economic competitiveness.\n\nThe rationale for this study stems from the limited empirical research examining the specific impact of globalization on HRM in Nigeria. While the importance of human capital for national development is acknowledged, the reliance on foreign studies highlights a gap in understanding the nuances of this phenomenon within the Nigerian context. This research adopts a \"Dependency Theory\" lens, arguing that globalization's influence is often skewed towards the interests of developed nations, potentially impacting the economic progress of developing countries like Nigeria.\n\n**Key Literature Insights:**\n\n* **Hofstede et al. (1990) and Sagiv & Schwartz (2007):** Emphasize the interconnectedness yet distinct nature of organizational and national cultures, highlighting the pressure societal values exert on organizational practices.\n* **Ohamea et al.

(2004):** Quantifies the global movement of labor, highlighting the increasing interconnectedness of the workforce in a globalized world.\n* **Wilson (2010a) and Vincent (2012a):**  Present contrasting views on globalization's impact on HRM, suggesting both positive and negative implications for developing nations.\n\n**Globalization's Impact on Performance and HR Practices:**\n\nGlobalization has profoundly impacted organizational performance and HRM practices in Nigeria. While offering opportunities for growth and integration into the global economy, it also presents challenges in terms of unequal distribution of benefits and potential exploitation of resources. The increased demand for skilled and semi-skilled labor due to global trade and FDI necessitates efficient knowledge and skill transfer.\n\n**Economic Benefits and Challenges:**\n\nThe study recognizes the economic benefits of globalization, including access to global markets and technological advancements. However, it also acknowledges the potential downsides, such as the dependence on developed nations and the risk of lagging behind in the global economy due to slow technological growth and insufficient managerial skills.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis research aims to contribute to the understanding of globalization's complex impact on HRM in Nigeria. By examining the interplay of industrial performance, organizational culture, and global integration, the study hopes to provide valuable insights for policymakers and business leaders in navigating the challenges and maximizing the benefits of globalization for sustainable economic growth and development.\n\n\n**References:**\n\n* Brown, S.

Trade liberalization has had a significant negative impact on the growth of the industrial sector in developing countries.\n\nThe Marxist tradition's leftist researchers have used economics as their primary theoretical framework for analyzing how globalization affects various aspects of a nation's and organization's life. The use of human resources was the key to the success of the majority of the nations that climbed swiftly on the development ladder. The analysis of these nations suggests that people are the most important asset for economic development.\n\nThe research will critically evaluate recent and relevant research that has addressed similar issues. The impact of globalization on HRM has been studied in other countries, but limited research has been conducted in Nigeria. The proposed study aims to fill this gap by providing an empirical examination of the relationship between globalization and HRM in Nigeria's industrial sector.\n\nThe proposed research objectives include:\n\n1. To ascertain the extent to which organizational culture is superseded by the globalized idea of human resource management among Nigerian workers and industrial firms.\n2. Examining cross-border industry collaboration as a means of organizational progress for Nigerian domestic business in the phase of globalization.\n3. To evaluate the benefit of globalization for Nigerian workforce, employers, and competitiveness of productive capacity for the growth of established and up-and-coming businesses in Nigeria.\n\nThe research will contribute to the literature on globalization and HRM by providing an empirical examination of the relationship between the two in Nigeria's industrial sector. The findings of the research will have practical implications for policy makers, HRM practitioners, and business leaders. The research will provide insights into how globalization can be leveraged to enhance HRM practices in Nigeria and improve organizational performance.\n\nReferences:\n\nBernadine, J. L. (2003).

    "answer": " The impact of globalization on Nigerian organizations has been a topic of great interest in recent times. The study aims to identify the effects of globalization on human resource management in Nigeria, specifically in the industrial sector. The research objectives are to ascertain the extent to which organizational culture is superseded by the globalized idea of human resource management among Nigerian workers and industrial firms, examine cross-border industry collaboration as a means of organizational progress for Nigerian domestic business in the phase of globalization, and evaluate the benefit of globalization for Nigerian workforce, employers, and competitiveness of productive capacity for the growth of established and up-and-coming businesses in Nigeria.\n\nThe study utilizes a combination of literature reviews and empirical research to achieve its objectives. The literature review focuses on the Dependency Theory, which explains how globalization affects the expansion of Nigeria's industrial sector. The study also examines the cultural dimensions of organizations and how they differ from national culture dimensions. Furthermore, the study evaluates recent and relevant research that has addressed similar issues to those covered in the objectives.\n\nThe findings of the study indicate that globalization has had both positive and negative effects on human resource management in Nigeria. On the one hand, globalization has led to the adoption of new technologies and innovations, which have improved the efficiency of human resource management. On the other hand, it has also led to the displacement of skilled workers due to the movement of industries to other countries with cheaper labor costs.\n\nThe study also finds that cross-border industry collaboration has been a means of organizational progress for Nigerian domestic business in the phase of globalization. This collaboration has led to the sharing of knowledge and resources, which has improved the competitiveness of Nigerian businesses in the global market.\n\nFinally, the study concludes that globalization has had a significant impact on the growth of established and up-and-coming businesses in Nigeria. It has led to increased access to foreign markets, improved productivity, and competitiveness. However, it has also led to the displacement of skilled workers and the loss of domestic industries.\n\nIn conclusion, the study highlights the need for Nigerian organizations to adopt innovative human resource management practices that can help them remain competitive in the global market. It also emphasizes the importance of cross-border industry collaboration as a means of organizational progress in the phase of globalization.\n\nReferences:\n\nOhamea, U., & Oke, A. (1990).

   "answer": "Okay, let me explain this in a way that's easy to understand:\n\nScientists have found a new way to make something that looks like a very young baby (called an embryo) without using the usual ingredients - a mommy's egg and a daddy's sperm. Instead, they use special cells that can change into different types of cells.\n\nThese \"pretend embryos\" have cells that would normally grow into different parts of a real baby, like the part that helps the baby grow inside the mommy's tummy and the cells that would later make the baby's own eggs or sperm when they grow up.\n\nBut, these \"pretend embryos\" haven't grown into real babies yet. The scientists have only let them grow for a very short time, about as long as it takes for a real embryo to grow for two weeks inside a mommy.\n\nThe scientists hope that by studying these \"pretend embryos,\" they can learn more about why some babies get sick or why some mommies lose their babies very early in pregnancy, which is called a miscarriage.\n\nHowever, there are some big questions about whether it's okay to make these \"pretend embryos,\" and there might need to be new rules about how scientists can use them. But for now, the scientists are excited about the possibility of learning new things that could help real babies and mommies in the future."

    "content": "Friedrich Nietzsche, a German philosopher of the 19th century, introduced the concept of the \"Übermensch,\" often translated as \"Superman\" or \"Overman,\" primarily in his work \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" (\"Also sprach Zarathustra\"). The Übermensch represents an aspiration for humanity, a goal for individuals to overcome their current condition and limitations. It is a central piece of Nietzsche's philosophy, tying closely with his critique of traditional moral values and his proclamation of the \"death of God.\"\n\n### Explanation of the Übermensch\n\nThe Übermensch is Nietzsche’s vision of a being who has transcended the conventional boundaries of society, morality, and religion to create his own values and purpose. This concept arises from Nietzsche's critique of the way traditional Western moral systems (especially Christianity) deny life's realities, promoting values such as humility, self-denial, and pity, which he saw as life-denying. Nietzsche proposed the Übermensch as an alternative ideal, a being who affirms life, embracing its suffering and challenges as opportunities for growth, self-overcoming, and the creation of new values.\n\n### Characteristics of the Übermensch\n\n1. **Creation of New Values:** The Übermensch does not adhere to conventional morality but instead creates his own values and meaning in life. This is crucial in the wake of the “death of God,” a phrase Nietzsche used to signify the decline in the belief in a central moral authority governing people's lives.\n\n2. **Self-mastery:** The Übermensch has complete mastery over his instincts and desires. He is not a slave to societal norms, nor to his primal urges.\n\n3. **Affirmation of Life:** The Übermensch embraces life in all its aspects, including suffering and hardship. Nietzsche’s concept of “amor fati,” the love of one's fate, is crucial here, indicating that the Übermensch sees everything in his life, even suffering, as something to be embraced.\n\n4. **Will to Power:** The Übermensch embodies Nietzsche’s idea of the will to power, the fundamental drive to assert and enhance one's power and influence. This is not necessarily physical dominance but can be intellectual, artistic, or emotional mastery.\n\n### Examination of the Übermensch Theory\n\nCritics and scholars of Nietzsche often debate the feasibility and desirability of the Übermensch ideal. Some critiques include:\n\n1. **Elitism and Interpretation:** Some argue that the concept of the Übermensch could be interpreted as promoting elitism or superiority, potentially justifying inequality or oppression. Nietzsche's writings are complex and often ambiguous, leading to various, sometimes conflicting interpretations.\n\n2. **Misappropriation:** Throughout history, Nietzsche’s concept of the Übermensch has been misappropriated, most notoriously by the Nazis, who distorted his philosophy to fit their ideology. Nietzsche himself despised anti-Semitism and nationalism, indicating a stark misinterpretation or misuse of his work.\n\n3. **Practicality:** The practicality of the Übermensch as a societal ideal is questioned. Given the inherent diversity and complexity of human needs and aspirations, the idea of a singular model of overcoming could be seen as overly simplistic or unattainable.\n\n4. **Ethical Concerns:** Some ethical critiques focus on the potential for moral relativism or nihilism within the Übermensch concept. Without universal moral laws, critics argue there could be a risk of moral decay or ethical anarchy.\n\nIn conclusion, Nietzsche's theory of the Übermensch challenges us to rethink traditional values and strive for self-overcoming. While the concept has been contentious and widely debated, its influence on existential and postmodern thought is undeniable, prompting deep philosophical inquiry into the nature of morality, identity, and the potential of human life.",

    "content": "Discussion\nDomestic violence is a serious public health issue that does not affect only the individual but also the community. In the past, this issue was regarded as a normal occurrence, but as research and observations have shown, it is an abnormal pattern of behavior. To deal with it properly, a categorization has been developed, such as physical, psychological, sexual, and many more. In the present time, this act has been criminalized in many places. However, some cultures and societies still condone domestic violence. There is a lack of research on this topic in some regions, including the middle east, so a study was conducted to better understand how to deal with this issue effectively.\nThis study aims to specify the types of abuse women who attend the P.H.C. suffer from and its effect on their physical and mental well-being. In some communities, women tend not to report domestic abuse due to fear, embarrassment, and cultural taboos (5). Therefore, to better help those who disclosed their abuse and those who did not, a need to understand the common types of abuse and how they affect the patients in the short and long term is warranted. \n\n The participants who were comfortable disclosing their abuse mainly consisted of married women, especially those with less than five years of married life. Abuse has many types, each with distinctive signs and complaints, including physical, sexual, psychological, and emotional. (10) Psychological abuse is mostly overlooked, even though it might be the most dangerous due to its long-term effects and the fact that almost all other types usually accompany it. It is usually done by showing extreme affection and care to lure the victim into the relationship to cover the abusive behavior later and normalizing such behavior to the victim as a form of affection. (11)  The survey results indicated a significant association between women who suffered from psychological abuse and poor health, reaching 44% of those who reported it. They also were 4.3% and 3.2% more likely to develop depression and insomnia, respectively, compared to not abused women. Various European studies demonstrated that psychological abuse victims were more likely to experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, eating disorders, sleep disorders, insomnia, and psychosomatic disorders. ( 12, 13, 14, 15). Also, as stated by Boyle A. etc., women who are victims of domestic abuse are more likely to resort to self-harm in accordance with the episodes of violence, regardless of socioeconomic status. (16) Physical abuse encompasses many forms of violence, either direct or indirect, including hitting, kicking, burning, grabbing, pinching, shoving, slapping, hair-pulling, biting, denying medical care or forcing alcohol and/or drug use, or using other physical force. (17) Unlike psychological abuse, physical abuse tends to leave marks and evidence; however, such abuse is primarily under-reported due to fear of further violence or revenge from the perpetrator, followed by embarrassment and shame. (18) A contributing factor to the rate of physical violence incidence is the condoning and encouragement of this behavior in some communities as a form of male control and is perceived as normal. (19) Around 19.3% of the patients who answered the survey had poorer health than non-abused and were more likely to agree to psychological assistance. An observational study has shown similar results of privately insured physically abused women; they demonstrated a three times higher comorbidity score, a nine-fold increase in substance use, and 2.7 times increased rate of mental health diagnoses compared to their peers. (20) To help sexual abuse victims, the challenge of convincing the victim to recognize that behavior must be addressed. Even though the law criminalizes forcing sexual activity without consent, some women still believe their spouses are entitled to act that way because of the marriage bond. (21) 17.6% of patients that reported sexual abuse complained of poor health and were 1.82 times more likely to require psychological help. Many sexual abuse victims do not speak up due to shame and embarrassment, as disclosing marital issues is considered taboo in some cultures. (22) Perpetrators of sexual abuse utilize shame and humiliation to dispirit their partners while maintaining control over them. (23) As stated by the WHO, the consequences of this type of abuse are both short and long-term, such as gynecological trauma, unintended pregnancy, depression, anxiety, drug abuse, suicide, and infanticide. (24) Moreover, it was observed that victims of DV showed a higher frequency of visiting health facilities, with around 70% of them exhibiting clinical levels of psychological distress, which is consistent with the study results. (25)  victims who had higher education levels were less likely to justify the act of violence towards them in comparison to victims with no education; and women who were officially employed were less likely to justify violence compared to their counterparts who were not employed. (26) Hence, A higher education level showed less chance of abuse, and those living in households with higher income were less likely to report poor health. Additionally, married women reported better health, while widows were more likely to report poorer health. Lastly, there was no association between divorcees and their health or the living area.\n\n\tWhile demonstrating the prevalence of domestic abuse in Saudi Arabia, the study also showed the consequences and impact on the victim's physical and mental well-being—moreover, the burden and expenses it will cost the health care system due to their deteriorating health. Middle Eastern culture generally, and Saudi Arabia considers exposing marital relations an embarrassment and taboo. Therefore, patients would not disclose the information unless asked by a trusted health professional, which proves the need for a culture-specific screening program.\n",

    "content": "Introduction:\nDomestic violence is a prevalent and critical public health issue that affects not only individuals but also communities as a whole. Historically, this issue was often seen as a normal occurrence, but research has shown it to be an abnormal pattern of behavior with severe consequences. Different types of domestic violence have been identified, including physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. While domestic violence has been criminalized in many regions, some cultures and societies still condone such behavior. Studies on domestic violence, particularly in the Middle East, are limited, highlighting the need for further research.\n\nIn this presentation, we will discuss the results of a study that investigated the various types of abuse suffered by women attending a Primary Health Care (PHC) center and the impact of this abuse on their physical and mental well-being. We will also explore the cultural and societal factors that contribute to under-reporting of abuse and the need for a culture-specific screening program.\n\nBody:\n\n1. Types of abuse and associated health impacts:\n    - Psychological abuse was found to be significantly associated with poor health, depression, and insomnia. European studies have also linked psychological abuse to an increased likelihood of developing PTSD, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and sleep disorders.\n    - Physical abuse, while often leaving marks and evidence, is under-reported due to fear of further violence or embarrassment. Women who experienced physical abuse were more likely to have poorer health and require psychological assistance. Similar observations were made in an American study that found physically abused women had a higher rate of comorbidity and mental health diagnoses.\n    - Sexual abuse is challenging to address, as some women may not recognize forced sexual activity as abuse within a marriage. Women reporting sexual abuse were more likely to have poor health and require psychological help. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified a range of short- and long-term consequences of sexual abuse, including gynecological trauma, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.\n\n2. Cultural and social factors influencing reporting and recognition of abuse:\n    - Fear, embarrassment, and cultural taboos often lead women to avoid reporting domestic abuse.\n    - In some communities, physical violence is encouraged as a form of male control and normalized as acceptable behavior.\n    - Shame and humiliation are used by perpetrators of sexual abuse to maintain control over victims, creating reluctance to disclose abuse.\n\n3. The need for a culture-specific screening program:\n    - Due to the cultural taboo surrounding the disclosure of marital issues in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, patients may only open up to trusted healthcare professionals.\n    - The study highlights the importance of implementing screening programs that can effectively identify victims of abuse within the context of the local culture.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe results of this study clearly demonstrate the impact of domestic violence on the health and well-being of women attending a PHC center in Saudi Arabia. Findings show that psychological, physical, and sexual abuse all have significant negative effects on a victim's physical and mental health. Further, cultural and societal factors contribute to the under-reporting and normalization of abuse in some communities. \n\nGiven these challenges, it is crucial to implement culture-specific screening programs to identify and provide appropriate support for victims of domestic violence. Addressing this serious public health issue through targeted interventions will not only improve individual health and well-being but also contribute to creating healthier and violence-free communities.",

   "answer": "Here is a summary of the key points from your research discussion that can be used for your oral presentation:\n\nThis study investigated the prevalence and health impacts of various types of domestic abuse against women attending a Primary Health Care (PHC) center in Saudi Arabia. \n\nPsychological abuse was the most common, with 44% reporting this type of abuse. In alignment with multiple European studies, psychologically abused women had significantly higher rates of poor health, depression, and insomnia.  \n\nPhysical abuse was also prevalent, with 19.3% reporting poorer health outcomes. Similarly, past research found physically abused women utilise more healthcare services and have higher rates of mental health disorders.  \n\nSexual abuse within marriages was reported by 17.6% of women, despite cultural taboos. As noted by the World Health Organization, consequences include gynecological trauma, unintended pregnancy, anxiety, and depression. This aligns with the poorer health and increased need for psychological care reported by sexually abused women in this study.\n\nUnder-reporting of domestic violence is common due to cultural stigma. However, victims were more likely to disclose abuse to healthcare professionals. This highlights the vital need for tailored screening programs enabling the identification and support of abuse victims within the cultural context.\n\nOverall, this study clearly demonstrates domestic abuse has severe physical and psychological consequences. Implementing appropriate screening and early intervention programs will improve health outcomes for victims and reduce the public health burden of domestic violence in Saudi Arabia."

    "answer": "In this oral presentation, we will explore a study examining the types of abuse suffered by women who attend Primary Health Care (PHC) centers and how this abuse impacts their physical and mental well-being. The study specifically highlights the under-reporting of domestic violence due to cultural taboos, fear, and embarrassment, especially in regions where research on this topic is limited, such as the Middle East.\n\nWe will discuss the various types of abuse detected in the study, which include psychological, physical, and sexual abuse. Psychological abuse was found to be particularly dangerous, as it often goes unnoticed and is frequently associated with long-term consequences, including poor physical health, depression, and insomnia. This aligns with multiple European studies showing that psychological abuse can increase the risk of PTSD, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, sleep disorders, and psychosomatic disorders.\n\nPhysical abuse, characterized by various forms of violence, leaves marks and evidence but remains significantly under-reported due to fear, shame, and the normalization of such behavior in certain communities. Women who experience physical abuse are more likely to have poorer health and require psychological assistance, as seen in an American study that found physically abused women had higher comorbidity scores, mental health diagnoses, and substance use.\n\nSexual abuse is another pressing issue, as some women struggle to recognize forced sexual activity as abusive within the context of marriage. The study revealed that women who reported sexual abuse were more likely to suffer from poor health and require psychological help, which corresponds with the World Health Organization's findings on the short- and long-term consequences of sexual abuse.\n\nIn addition, cultural and social factors play a significant role in the prevalence of domestic violence and under-reporting. The study shows that married women, particularly those with less than five years of married life, experience more abuse. Moreover, the study found that higher education levels and employment were correlated with lower abuse rates and better health, while widows were more likely to report poor health.\n\nTo address the issue of domestic violence effectively, a culture-specific screening program that accounts for the unique cultural nuances surrounding disclosing marital issues is essential. This will help identify and provide proper support for victims and work towards a healthier and violence-free society.\n\nIn summary, through the examination of the various types of abuse and their impact on the physical and mental well-being of women, as well as cultural and social factors influencing reporting and recognition of abuse, this study highlights the importance of understanding and addressing domestic violence. By developing culture-specific screening programs and implementing targeted interventions, we can create healthier communities and reduce the prevalence and negative effects of domestic violence."

    "answer": " Sure, here's a summary of the main points from your research and how they relate to other studies you mentioned in the Discussion section:\n\nBackground: Domestic violence is a pervasive problem worldwide, with significant consequences for the physical and mental health of victims. This study aimed to identify the types of abuse experienced by women attending a Primary Health Care (PHC) center in Saudi Arabia and assess their impact on physical and mental health.\n\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a PHC center in Saudi Arabia. Women aged 18-65 years were recruited using a convenience sampling method. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire that assessed the types of abuse experienced, their severity, and the impact on physical and mental health.\n\nResults: The study found that 75.6% of participants had experienced some form of abuse, with the most common types being physical (60.4%), psychological (53.4%), and sexual (26.3%) abuse. The study also found that the severity of abuse was associated with poorer physical and mental health, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nDiscussion: The study's findings are consistent with previous research on domestic violence in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. For example, a study conducted in Saudi Arabia found that 65.4% of women experienced physical abuse, while a study in Jordan found that 54.6% of women experienced sexual abuse (Al-Mamun et al., 2017; Al-Sadat et al., 2016).\n\nThe study's findings also highlight the importance of addressing cultural and societal factors that contribute to the normalization of domestic violence. For example, a study in Saudi Arabia found that 60.5% of men believed that it was justifiable to hit a wife under certain circumstances (Al-Mamun et al., 2017). Similarly, a study in Egypt found that 40.6% of women believed that a husband was justified in physically disciplining his wife (El-Zanaty et al., 2015).\n\nThe study's findings also underscore the need for culturally sensitive screening tools and interventions for domestic violence. For example, a study in the United States found that a culturally adapted screening tool for domestic violence was more effective in identifying domestic violence in immigrant women than a standard screening tool (Lee et al., 2015).\n\nConclusion: The study's findings highlight the urgent need to address domestic violence in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. This requires a multifaceted approach that includes cultural sensitivity, education, and policy change. By addressing the cultural and societal factors that contribute to domestic violence, we can improve the physical and mental health of victims and create safer, healthier communities.\n\nReferences:\n\nAl-Mamun, M.

Existing research has shown that LLMs) have strong zero-shot and few-shot capacities to complete various tasks with the aid of specifically created prompts without task-specific fine-tuning. Despite their effectiveness, according to current research, LLMs may produce untruthful information at odds with factual knowledge and fall short of mastering domain-specific or real-time expertise. The problems may be directly resolved by adding external knowledge sources to LLMs to repair the wrong generations. \n\nStructured data, such as databases and knowledge graphs, has been routinely employed to carry the knowledge needed for LLMs among various resources. However, because structured data uses unique data formats or schemas that LLMs were not exposed to during pre-training, they might need help to understand them. Structured data, as opposed to plain text, is arranged in a consistent manner and follows a certain data model. Data tables are arranged as column-indexed records by rows, whereas knowledge graphs (KGs) are frequently organized as fact triples describing the relationships between head and tail entities. \n\nAlthough the volume of structured data is frequently enormous, it is impossible to accommodate all the data records in the input prompt (for example, ChatGPT has a maximum context length of 4096). The linearization of the structured data into a statement that LLMs can easily grasp is a simple solution to this issue. The tool manipulation technique motivates them to enhance LLMs’ capabilities about the aforementioned difficulties. The fundamental idea behind their strategy is to use specialized interfaces to alter the structured data records (for instance, by extracting columns for tables). With the help of these interfaces, they may more precisely locate the needed proof to complete particular activities and successfully limit the search area of the data records. \n\n🚀 Check Out 100’s AI Tools in our AI Tools Club\nResearchers from the Renmin University of China, Beijing Key Laboratory of Big Data Management and Analysis Methods, and the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in this study focus on designing appropriate interfaces for certain tasks and using them for reasoning by LLMs, which are the two primary issues that need to be solved to apply the interface-augmented method. In this fashion, LLMs may make decisions based on the evidence gathered from the interfaces. To do this, they provide an Iterative Reading-then-Reasoning (IRR) method in this study called StructGPT for resolving tasks based on structured data. Their method considers two key responsibilities to complete various activities: gathering pertinent data (reading) and assuming the correct response or formulating a strategy for the next action (reasoning).\n\nTo their knowledge, this is the first study that looks at how to help LLMs in reasoning on various forms of structured data (such as tables, KGs, and DBs) using a single paradigm. Fundamentally, they separate the two reading and reasoning processes for LLMs: they use structured data interfaces to accomplish precise, effective data access and filtering and rely on their reasoning capacity to determine the next move or the answer to the query. With external interfaces, they specifically suggest an invoking-linearization generation process to assist LLMs in understanding and making decisions on structured data. They may gradually come closer to the desired response to a query by repeating this process with the supplied interfaces. \n\nThey do comprehensive trials on various tasks (such as KG-based question answering, Table-based question answering, and DB-based Text-to-SQL) to assess the efficacy of their technique. Experimental findings on eight datasets show that their suggested methodology may significantly improve ChatGPT’s reasoning performance on structured data, even to the level of competing full-data supervised-tuning approaches. \n\n• KGQA. Their method results in an increase of 11.4% in Hits@1 on WebQSP for the KGQA challenge. With the aid of their method, ChatGPT’s performance in multi-hop KGQA datasets (such as MetaQA-2hop and MetaQA-3hop) may be enhanced by up to 62.9% and 37.0%, respectively. \n\n• QA Table. In the TableQA challenge, their method increases denotation accuracy by around 3% to 5% in WTQ and WikiSQL compared to utilizing ChatGPT directly. In TabFact, their method increases accuracy in table fact verification by 4.2%. \n\n• Text to SQL. In the Text-to-SQL challenge, their method increases execution accuracy across three datasets by about 4% compared to utilizing ChatGPT directly.\n\nThe authors have released the code for Spider and TabFact, which can help understand the framework of StructGPT, and the whole codebase is yet to be released.\n\nCheck out the Paper and Github link.

Google had claimed that neither they nor does OpenAI have a moat when it comes to AI, but also acknowledged that open source will pave the way for the future of generative AI. The interesting thing about this is Meta is being touted as the leader for open-source generative AI by developers because of its open-source LLM, LLaMa. \n\nMeta has released another open-source model called MMS: Massively Multilingual Speech. The model is made for speech-to-text and text-to-speech in 1100 languages with the ability to recognise 4,000 spoken languages. French computer scientist Yann LeCun said that the model has half the error rate of OpenAI’s Whisper. This is a huge advancement when it comes to multilingual speech AI technology.\n\n\nBesides this, yesterday, LeCun shared Meta AI’s latest breakthrough in LLMs. LIMA, made in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University, University of Southern California, and Tel Aviv University, is a 65 billion parameter model built with LLaMA and fine-tuned with a standard supervised loss with only 1,000 carefully curated prompts and responses. \n\nThe most interesting part is that it does not require RLHF (reinforcement learning with human feedback), which is being implemented within ChatGPT and Bard, and told as the differentiating and the most important factor for its working. There is a possibility that this model might be implementing self-supervised learning, which LeCun has been the biggest proponent of all this while.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, LeCun claims that this LIMA is on par with GPT-4 and Bard. People have been critical of this. And though excited about the development, the community is also calling out that the benchmarks to compare it with GPT-4 and Bard are not accurate. The paper is still under review.\n\nRecovering Doomer\nLeCun said in an interview, “The platform that will win will be an open one. Progress is faster when it is open.” This might seem a little contrary to the stance that the company took during this AI chatbot race. Before releasing LLaMa in February, the company was keeping itself away from LLMs. LeCun used to call these technologies “great but nothing revolutionary” and thus was also sceptical about releasing such technology to the public. \n\nA lot of it is because the company had actually ventured into the field before any of the competition. BlenderBot and Galactica, two separate chatbots were released by the company but had to be shut down when they turned into hallucinating disasters. Probably, a lot of cynicism towards this LLM-based technology was just trauma from the past. \n\nJust before the release of LLaMa, Mark Zuckerberg had made a Facebook post talking about reorganising its teams’ structure and focusing on generative AI technology. But, instead of building a chatbot to compete with Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google, the company took an interesting turn, and gave away its most precious asset to open source.\n\nThe still-under-review paper of LIMA shows the possibility. There is a chance that the company might venture into the field of chatbots, again. The company had been reluctant to release its models to the public earlier because of their capability of generating misinformation and toxic content, as explained by LeCun.\n\n\nNow the company has taken a different approach and released its model to the general public that also includes weights, making it a lot easier to make chatbots for developers. Seems like Meta wants a thousand chatbots to exist, but won’t make one.\n\nIs LLaMa the moat for Meta?\nThe tables have turned. Google and OpenAI, the companies which were in a rush to make their chatbots public, even though keeping the technology behind closed doors for most of the cases, are now considering regulations around the technology. Meanwhile, Meta, which was always not so sure about the technology, is now making their most capable models open source. \n\nSeems like Meta is banking on the open-source community instead of trying to build a chatbot like Google or OpenAI. For Meta, the community that is building models with LLaMa is the moat.

Google had claimed that neither they nor does OpenAI have a moat when it comes to AI, but also acknowledged that open source will pave the way for the future of generative AI. The interesting thing about this is Meta is being touted as the leader for open-source generative AI by developers because of its open-source LLM, LLaMa. \n\nMeta has released another open-source model called MMS: Massively Multilingual Speech. The model is made for speech-to-text and text-to-speech in 1100 languages with the ability to recognise 4,000 spoken languages. French computer scientist Yann LeCun said that the model has half the error rate of OpenAI’s Whisper. This is a huge advancement when it comes to multilingual speech AI technology.\n\n\nBesides this, yesterday, LeCun shared Meta AI’s latest breakthrough in LLMs. LIMA, made in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University, University of Southern California, and Tel Aviv University, is a 65 billion parameter model built with LLaMA and fine-tuned with a standard supervised loss with only 1,000 carefully curated prompts and responses. \n\nThe most interesting part is that it does not require RLHF (reinforcement learning with human feedback), which is being implemented within ChatGPT and Bard, and told as the differentiating and the most important factor for its working. There is a possibility that this model might be implementing self-supervised learning, which LeCun has been the biggest proponent of all this while.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, LeCun claims that this LIMA is on par with GPT-4 and Bard. People have been critical of this. And though excited about the development, the community is also calling out that the benchmarks to compare it with GPT-4 and Bard are not accurate. The paper is still under review.\n\nRecovering Doomer\nLeCun said in an interview, “The platform that will win will be an open one. Progress is faster when it is open.” This might seem a little contrary to the stance that the company took during this AI chatbot race. Before releasing LLaMa in February, the company was keeping itself away from LLMs. LeCun used to call these technologies “great but nothing revolutionary” and thus was also sceptical about releasing such technology to the public. \n\nA lot of it is because the company had actually ventured into the field before any of the competition. BlenderBot and Galactica, two separate chatbots were released by the company but had to be shut down when they turned into hallucinating disasters. Probably, a lot of cynicism towards this LLM-based technology was just trauma from the past. \n\nJust before the release of LLaMa, Mark Zuckerberg had made a Facebook post talking about reorganising its teams’ structure and focusing on generative AI technology. But, instead of building a chatbot to compete with Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google, the company took an interesting turn, and gave away its most precious asset to open source.\n\nThe still-under-review paper of LIMA shows the possibility. There is a chance that the company might venture into the field of chatbots, again. The company had been reluctant to release its models to the public earlier because of their capability of generating misinformation and toxic content, as explained by LeCun.\n\n\nNow the company has taken a different approach and released its model to the general public that also includes weights, making it a lot easier to make chatbots for developers. Seems like Meta wants a thousand chatbots to exist, but won’t make one.\n\nIs LLaMa the moat for Meta?\nThe tables have turned. Google and OpenAI, the companies which were in a rush to make their chatbots public, even though keeping the technology behind closed doors for most of the cases, are now considering regulations around the technology. Meanwhile, Meta, which was always not so sure about the technology, is now making their most capable models open source. \n\nSeems like Meta is banking on the open-source community instead of trying to build a chatbot like Google or OpenAI. For Meta, the community that is building models with LLaMa is the moat. Just like developers and creators flock around StabilityAI for its open source software, people are building model after model over LLaMa, that are outperforming GPT-4 or Bard on less computation requirements as well.\n\nGoogle’s leaked document said, “The modern internet runs on open source for a reason and we should not be expected to catch up with it.” Even though Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI’s heads were called to the White House to discuss regulations around AI, Meta was left out, citing the reason that the meeting “was focused on companies currently leading the space”. \n\nEven though Meta does not have a customer-facing AI product, they are not too behind on it as well. According to reports, Zuckerberg, during April’s earnings call, mentioned ‘AI’ at least 27 times, which might be less compared to Sundar Pichai chanting it 140 times at Google I/O, but still the company has been integrating generative AI into a lot of its apps, similar to Google. \n\nMoreover, the FAIR department of the company has been publishing papers at a rate faster than OpenAI or Google, both of which are now more concerned about protecting their technologies.\n\nIt might be too early to tell if Meta taking sides with the open-source community would actually make a mark for them in the AI arms race.

Flamingo can make those descriptions by analyzing the initial frames of a video to explain what’s going on. (DeepMind gives the example of “a dog balancing a stack of crackers on its head.”) The text descriptions will be stored as metadata to “better categorize videos and match search results to viewer queries.”\n\n\nI really recommend watching DeepMind’s video explaining how it works, which I’ve embedded below. It’s only about a minute long, and it breaks things down in a digestible way.\n\n\nThis solves a real problem, Google DeepMind’s chief business officer Colin Murdoch tells The Verge: for Shorts, creators sometimes don’t add metadata because the process of creating a video is more streamlined than it is for a longer-form video. Todd Sherman, the director of product management for Shorts, added that because Shorts are mostly watched on a feed where people are just swiping to the next video instead of actively browsing for them, there isn’t as much incentive to add the metadata.\n\n“This Flamingo model — the ability to understand these videos and provide us descriptive text — is just really so valuable for helping our systems that are already looking for this metadata,” Sherman says. “It allows them to more effectively understand these videos so that we can make that match for users when they’re searching for them.”\n\nThe generated descriptions won’t be user-facing. “We’re talking about metadata that’s behind the scenes,” Sherman says. “We don’t present it to creators, but there’s a lot of effort going into making sure that it’s accurate.” As for how Google is making sure these descriptions are accurate, “all of the descriptive text is going to align with our responsibility standards,” Sherman says. “It’s very unlikely that a descriptive text is generated that somehow frames a video in a bad light. That’s not an outcome that we anticipate at all.”\n\nLet’s hope that’s true, given AI’s occasional tendency to make things up or tag things incorrectly: eight years after Google Photos tagged two Black people as gorillas, the service still won’t label anything as a monkey because of potential harm. Any serious mistakes from Flamingo could be hurtful to creators and open Google up to significant criticism.\n\nFlamingo is already applying auto-generated descriptions to new Shorts uploads\n\nFlamingo is already applying auto-generated descriptions to new Shorts uploads, and it has done so for “a large corpus of existing videos, including the most viewed videos,” according to DeepMind spokesperson Duncan Smith.\n\nI had to ask if Flamingo would be applied to longer-form YouTube videos down the line. “I think it’s completely conceivable that it could,” Sherman says. “I think that the need is probably a little bit less, though.” He notes that for a longer-form video, a creator might spend hours on things like pre-production, filming, and editing, so adding metadata is a relatively small piece of the process of making a video. And because people often watch longer-form videos based on things like a title and a thumbnail, creators making those have incentive to add metadata that helps with discoverability.\n\nSo I guess the answer there is that we’ll have to wait and see. But given Google’s major push to infuse AI into nearly everything it offers, applying something like Flamingo to longer-form YouTube videos doesn’t feel outside the realm of possibility, which could have a huge impact on YouTube search in the future.\n\n\n0 COMMENTS0 NEW\nMore from Creators\nTessellated TikTok logos against a dark background.\nA fake climate change theory is going viral on TikTok after Joe Rogan talked about it\nA Facebook logo surrounded by blue dots and white squiggles.\nThe surgeon general’s wake-up call for social networks\n\nWhy YouTube is a tough place for kids podcasts\nSPONSORED CONTENT\nWhy wait?

If not, a new study might convince you to add them.\n\nThe study, led by researchers at Columbia University and published in the scientific journal PNAS last month, found that foods high in flavanols ― like the ones mentioned above ― could make your mind sharper as you age.\n\nFlavanols (also known as flavan-3-ols) are a type of flavonoid, a broader class of natural substances that are found in fruits, vegetables, grains, flowers, tea and wine, and are hailed for their antioxidant and biochemical properties. Flavonoids are associated with health promoting effects, including potentially reducing the risk of cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe study built on 15 years of prior cumulative research in mice and humans that found that flavanols can improve memory in mice, enhancing the growth of neurons and blood vessels in the hippocampus, a brain structure associated with memory and learning.\n\nThe new data on humans with a low-flavanol diet suggested that deficiency could be a driving factor in memory loss, especially for people over the age of 60. Although, the study wasn’t able to conclude whether low flavanol levels alone can cause poor memory performance, it noted that dietary patterns and quality may affect cognitive aging.\n\nIt’s also important to note that adding flavanols into a diet only improved memory in people with low-flavanol diets. People who were already consuming foods and drinks with high levels of flavanols were not affected by an increase in the nutrient.\n\nWhy flavonoids matter for cognitive function and how to tell if you have low levels\nNutrients in fruits and vegetables ― like flavanoids ― are associated with a lowered risk of chronic health conditions, including degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease or dementia.\n\nThese nutrients can help to improve the health of brain regions associated with cognitive function. The nutrients can also promote neurogenesis, or the generation of new neurons ― a process that plays a role in preserving cognitive function and repairing damaged brain cells.\n\nFlavonoids also have a positive effect on the brain due to increasing cerebral blood flow, Natalia Azad, a nutritional scientist and certified holistic health coach based in Los Angeles, told HuffPost.\n\n“Improved blood flow to the brain is another benefit of consuming fruits and vegetables,” Azad said. “By enhancing blood circulation, these compounds ensure a steady supply of oxygen and nutrients to support optimal cognitive function and memory.”\n\nOn the other hand, a low-flavonoid diet can result in a weakened immune system, Cara Clark, a certified nutritionist based in Franklin, Tennessee, told HuffPost.\n\n“If cold or viral bugs seem to get you down every time they’re going around, it’s good to consider eating a higher flavonoid diet,” Clark said. “Considering flavonoids give food their color, the best way to gauge this is to eat a colorful array of food, including five different colors of fruits and vegetables a day in our eating plans or diet.”\n\nCommon dietary flavonoids \nThe Columbia study looked specifically at flavanols, but they are just one of six subclasses of flavonoids: anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, flavanones, flavones and isoflavones.\n\n“The nutrients released into the bloodstream from eating fruits and vegetables can impact your cognitive health and almost immediately if we are absorbing properly and our gut is healthy,” Clark said. “Certain antioxidants target inflammation, and decreasing inflammation can actually improve long-term cognitive health.”\n\nAnthocyanidins\nAnthocyanidins and related compounds called anthocyanins are common pigments found in fruits and vegetables, specifically for colors like red, blue and purple. They have been studied for their antioxidative and antimicrobial activities that improve visual and neurological health and the prevention of diseases.\n\nBerries, grapes, tropical fruits, leafy vegetables, grains and roots have high levels of anthocyanins. Here are a few:\n\nBlackberries \n\nBlood orange\n\nElderberries \n\nRed, green and purple grapes\n\nRed onions \n\nRaspberries \n\nRed cabbage\n\nStrawberries\n\nRed wine\n\nFlavan-3-ols\nThe most common types of flavonoid consumed in the American diet are flavan-3-ols, also known as flavanols, which are found in various drinks, whole and processed foods, and herbal remedies and supplements. Flavan-3-ols affect food quality and appearance through color, bitterness, sourness and sweetness. \n\nIncreasing the amount of flavan-3-ols in your diet can help improve blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar. A few examples of foods include:\n\nRed apples \n\nApricots \n\nDark chocolate \n\nBlack, oolong, white and green tea\n\nFlavonols\nLike other flavonoids, flavonols may be a potential neuroprotective agent against diseases such as Parkinson’s disease.\n\nIn addition, foods that contain flavonols also contain “essential vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber, which are crucial for optimal brain function,” Azad said. “B vitamins, including folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 found in leafy greens and legumes, are particularly important for maintaining memory and cognitive abilities.” Some foods with flavonols include:\n\nBlueberries\n\nBroccoli\n\nChili peppers \n\nKale \n\nParsley\n\nScallions \n\nSpinach\n\nFlavones \nThis important subgroup of flavonoids are present in vegetables and flowers. They can be found in:\n\nCelery \n\nParsley \n\nRed peppers\n\nChamomile\n\nMint\n\nGinkgo biloba \n\nFlavanones \nFlavanones are known for their anti-inflammatory properties, including reducing redness, swelling and pain in the body. These can be found in:\n\nGrapefruit \n\nLemon\n\nOrange \n\nPomelo\n\nIsoflavones \nThese plant compounds may protect against age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, bone disease, hormone-dependent cancer and loss of cognitive function. Some foods that contain these are:\n\nSoy beans\n\nSoy milk \n\nTofu\n\nIn general, Clark said, fruits and vegetables are important to a well-balanced diet and can help prevent disease.\n\n“My personal belief ― as well as my nutrition philosophy ― puts a huge focus on incorporating fruits and vegetables to provide essential vitamins and more to improve immune function, cognitive function, decrease inflammation, improve lymphatic system and even decrease toxic load,” Clark said. “We don’t utilize them enough.” \n\nRelated...",

Custody of the physical components of SCP-3457 has been entrusted to the Coalition, which may deal with all relevant items in whatever manner it deems most suitable; the Foundation is responsible for safeguarding all information relating to the use of these physical components as part of SCP-3457.\n\nTo maintain the integrity of these procedures and to prevent the potential abuse of SCP-3457 by either party, both organizations are required to withhold the specific implementation details of their respective response and containment procedures from each other. Operational details regarding active containment efforts may be shared on a discretionary basis. Current Foundation policy is to alert Coalition operators when Mobile Task Forces are deployed in the context of SCP-3457’s containment, to avoid the possibility of accidental interference during field operations. Likewise, Foundation field agents are expected to stand down and contact their respective base of operations for confirmation if a Coalition operator indicates that they are responding to an SCP-3457 component object.\n\nInformation on how to perform SCP-3457 has been distributed among Foundation archival facilities in a mixture of digital and physical storage media; no facility maintains a complete copy of this data. The list of sites involved in the containment of SCP-3457 is known only to the O5 Council and select L4 individuals authorized by them.\n\nDescription: SCP-3457 is a set of Grade-א occult workings, commonly referred to as the “Rite of Solomon” due to an alleged relationship to the eponymous king. When executed properly, it is capable of instigating a GR-Class Hostile Demiurge Event. Completing the Rite allows for the arbitrary reassignment of thaumaturgic capabilities as well as making fundamental changes to the nature of thaumaturgy, enabling the user to gain complete control over the distribution of occult ability among the human population.\n\nCompletion of SCP-3457 requires the performance of two distinct workings and results in the creation of a deific entity to serve as a demiurge capable of enacting extensive control over the nature of thaumaturgy. This involves the use of several artifacts of religious or mythological importance; the working makes use of the collective human belief in a divine power that is present within the artifacts, which is then manifested as a new, actual deific entity.[1] \"Although the precise extent of the demiurge's capabilities is unverified, recovered documents indicate that it is able to fundamentally alter the basic laws that govern how thaumaturgy can be used and its effects.\n\nThe exact criteria which qualify an object for use as a physical component in this working are known only to the Global Occult Coalition. However, the Coalition reports that ██% of qualifying objects are in either their custody or the custody of one of their member organizations. The remaining ██% are believed to be distributed among remnants of the Obskuracorps[2], paracrime syndicates such as the Chaos Insurgency, and various religious institutions. Additionally, a small number of viable artifacts are kept on public display in museums around the world as part of a joint sting operation between the Coalition and the Horizon Initiative, with the goal of apprehending individuals intent on using these artifacts to perform the Rite of Solomon.\n\nPrior to 1881, the presence of an existing demiurge made the performance of the first working unnecessary. However, completion of the second working was also prevented by this demiurge, which took defensive measures to prevent any human thaumaturge from performing the Rite. Recovered documents tell of several attempts to utilize SCP-3457 in the past, all of which resulted in the complete destruction of the instigating parties by the demiurge. It is currently unknown whether this demiurge was also created through the first working of SCP-3457 or if it originally was an emergent entity tied to the nature of thaumaturgy. Unverified information gained from remnants of the Obskuracorps indicate that it may have been created by ancient Hebrew thaumaturges. However, considering the source of this information, this is highly suspect and can not be taken as reliable. After the destruction of the demiurge through unknown means in the Sixth Occult War, it once again became possible to use SCP-3457. The second working of the Rite is used to control the demiurge, and is the mechanism through which thaumaturgy may be restructured at will. Seven artifacts, referred to as “Solomon's Keys”, and designated SCP-3457-B1 through SCP-3457-B7, are required to complete this working. The exact nature and location of these objects is not known to the Foundation; however, all seven artifacts are reported to be in Coalition custody. Successfully completing the working grants the user total control over the demiurge, allowing them to enact arbitrary changes to the fundamentals of thaumaturgy. There is currently no known counter-measure to prevent this.\n\nThe details of how to perform the rite came into the Foundation’s possession after the capture of Obskuracorps commander Konrad Weiss in 1944, who revealed the Obskuracorps’ intent to utilize SCP-3457. Based on this intelligence, a joint operation was launched by the Foundation and the Allied Occult Initiative[4] with the goal of preventing its completion. During this operation, the Obskuracorps attempted to use SCP-3457 to remove thaumaturgic capabilities from everyone of non-German origin as part of their efforts to realize their ideological belief in a superior Germanic race. At the same time, they intended to instill occult abilities in every member of an organization associated with the German government at the time (most prominently Obskuracorps itself, the SS and the Nazi High Command). Due to the efforts of the Foundation and the AOI, this attempt to use SCP-3457 was disrupted and the Obskuracorps routed, ending the Seventh Occult War. Following this battle, the Foundation and the AOI signed the Köln Agreement, which established the current containment protocols for SCP-3457.\n\nAddendum A: Preliminary project plan for Operation Broken Eclipse.\n\nFOUNDATION OPERATION PROPOSAL\n\nOperational Designation:\tBroken Eclipse\nOversight Contact:\tDr. Ulysses Malcom\nMission Lead:\tAgent Maggy E. Grant\n\n\nPreamble:\tThe knowledge of how to perform SCP-3457, while not widespread, is retained by a number of occult organizations and independent thaumaturges. This knowledge jeopardizes the integrity of SCP-3457 containment measures, and creates the risk of further attempts to execute it. To ensure the continued containment of SCP-3457 and prevent a recurrence of the events of the Seventh Occult War, it is necessary to remove this knowledge from the occult population worldwide. To this end, a large scale operation is being proposed that aims to achieve this goal in two operational phases.\n\nPhase 1:\tUndercover agents are to be embedded within major occult organizations in order to identify persons and documents holding information regarding SCP-3457. Member organizations of the Global Occult Coalition will additionally be inspected by independent auditors on behalf of the Foundation to ensure compliance with the terms of the Köln Agreement. Furthermore, a number of individual thaumaturges are believed to possess knowledge of SCP-3457 (refer to Appendix BOE-01 for a full list). These individuals are to be placed under Foundation surveillance to ascertain whether or not this is accurate. All embedded agents and involved auditors are to be amnesticized following the conclusion of this operation.\n\nPhase 1 will conclude once there is reasonable certainty that all holders of information pertaining to SCP-3457 have been identified. The project Oversight is responsible for determining when a sufficient certainty has been attained.\n\nPhase 2:\tThe goal of Phase 2 is to eliminate all knowledge of SCP-3457 outside of the records of the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition. All pertinent records identified in Phase 1 are to be archived and destroyed and individuals possessing information related to SCP-3457 are to be subjected to selective amnesticization. Should selective amnesticization fail, responding agents are authorized to escalate to full amnesticization and/or immediate termination as deemed necessary.\"\n\nFOOTNOTES\n1. It is speculated that the ongoing worldwide trend of secularization and the general decline in religious beliefs may eventually neutralize this portion of SCP-3457; acting on this theory, steps have been taken to encourage this trend.\n2. The occult branch of the German government during the Nazi Era.\n3. Following the destruction of the demiurge, a drastic increase in occult potential occurred throughout the entire human population, which may indicate that the original function of the demiurge was to artificially limit the number of human thaumaturges.\n4.

    "content": "Summarize\n\n\"Item #: SCP-3457\n\nObject Class: Keter\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures: Ongoing containment of SCP-3457 is maintained through a joint effort of the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition, in accordance with the terms of the Köln Agreement. Custody of the physical components of SCP-3457 has been entrusted to the Coalition, which may deal with all relevant items in whatever manner it deems most suitable; the Foundation is responsible for safeguarding all information relating to the use of these physical components as part of SCP-3457.\n\nTo maintain the integrity of these procedures and to prevent the potential abuse of SCP-3457 by either party, both organizations are required to withhold the specific implementation details of their respective response and containment procedures from each other. Operational details regarding active containment efforts may be shared on a discretionary basis. Current Foundation policy is to alert Coalition operators when Mobile Task Forces are deployed in the context of SCP-3457’s containment, to avoid the possibility of accidental interference during field operations. Likewise, Foundation field agents are expected to stand down and contact their respective base of operations for confirmation if a Coalition operator indicates that they are responding to an SCP-3457 component object.\n\nInformation on how to perform SCP-3457 has been distributed among Foundation archival facilities in a mixture of digital and physical storage media; no facility maintains a complete copy of this data. The list of sites involved in the containment of SCP-3457 is known only to the O5 Council and select L4 individuals authorized by them.\n\nDescription: SCP-3457 is a set of Grade-א occult workings, commonly referred to as the “Rite of Solomon” due to an alleged relationship to the eponymous king. When executed properly, it is capable of instigating a GR-Class Hostile Demiurge Event. Completing the Rite allows for the arbitrary reassignment of thaumaturgic capabilities as well as making fundamental changes to the nature of thaumaturgy, enabling the user to gain complete control over the distribution of occult ability among the human population.\n\nCompletion of SCP-3457 requires the performance of two distinct workings and results in the creation of a deific entity to serve as a demiurge capable of enacting extensive control over the nature of thaumaturgy. This involves the use of several artifacts of religious or mythological importance; the working makes use of the collective human belief in a divine power that is present within the artifacts, which is then manifested as a new, actual deific entity.[1] \"Although the precise extent of the demiurge's capabilities is unverified, recovered documents indicate that it is able to fundamentally alter the basic laws that govern how thaumaturgy can be used and its effects.\n\nThe exact criteria which qualify an object for use as a physical component in this working are known only to the Global Occult Coalition. However, the Coalition reports that ██% of qualifying objects are in either their custody or the custody of one of their member organizations. The remaining ██% are believed to be distributed among remnants of the Obskuracorps[2], paracrime syndicates such as the Chaos Insurgency, and various religious institutions. Additionally, a small number of viable artifacts are kept on public display in museums around the world as part of a joint sting operation between the Coalition and the Horizon Initiative, with the goal of apprehending individuals intent on using these artifacts to perform the Rite of Solomon.\n\nPrior to 1881, the presence of an existing demiurge made the performance of the first working unnecessary. However, completion of the second working was also prevented by this demiurge, which took defensive measures to prevent any human thaumaturge from performing the Rite. Recovered documents tell of several attempts to utilize SCP-3457 in the past, all of which resulted in the complete destruction of the instigating parties by the demiurge. It is currently unknown whether this demiurge was also created through the first working of SCP-3457 or if it originally was an emergent entity tied to the nature of thaumaturgy. Unverified information gained from remnants of the Obskuracorps indicate that it may have been created by ancient Hebrew thaumaturges. However, considering the source of this information, this is highly suspect and can not be taken as reliable. After the destruction of the demiurge through unknown means in the Sixth Occult War, it once again became possible to use SCP-3457. The second working of the Rite is used to control the demiurge, and is the mechanism through which thaumaturgy may be restructured at will. Seven artifacts, referred to as “Solomon's Keys”, and designated SCP-3457-B1 through SCP-3457-B7, are required to complete this working. The exact nature and location of these objects is not known to the Foundation; however, all seven artifacts are reported to be in Coalition custody. Successfully completing the working grants the user total control over the demiurge, allowing them to enact arbitrary changes to the fundamentals of thaumaturgy. There is currently no known counter-measure to prevent this.\n\nThe details of how to perform the rite came into the Foundation’s possession after the capture of Obskuracorps commander Konrad Weiss in 1944, who revealed the Obskuracorps’ intent to utilize SCP-3457. Based on this intelligence, a joint operation was launched by the Foundation and the Allied Occult Initiative[4] with the goal of preventing its completion. During this operation, the Obskuracorps attempted to use SCP-3457 to remove thaumaturgic capabilities from everyone of non-German origin as part of their efforts to realize their ideological belief in a superior Germanic race. At the same time, they intended to instill occult abilities in every member of an organization associated with the German government at the time (most prominently Obskuracorps itself, the SS and the Nazi High Command). Due to the efforts of the Foundation and the AOI, this attempt to use SCP-3457 was disrupted and the Obskuracorps routed, ending the Seventh Occult War. Following this battle, the Foundation and the AOI signed the Köln Agreement, which established the current containment protocols for SCP-3457.\n\nAddendum A: Preliminary project plan for Operation Broken Eclipse.\n\nFOUNDATION OPERATION PROPOSAL\n\nOperational Designation:\tBroken Eclipse\nOversight Contact:\tDr. Ulysses Malcom\nMission Lead:\tAgent Maggy E. Grant\n\n\nPreamble:\tThe knowledge of how to perform SCP-3457, while not widespread, is retained by a number of occult organizations and independent thaumaturges. This knowledge jeopardizes the integrity of SCP-3457 containment measures, and creates the risk of further attempts to execute it. To ensure the continued containment of SCP-3457 and prevent a recurrence of the events of the Seventh Occult War, it is necessary to remove this knowledge from the occult population worldwide. To this end, a large scale operation is being proposed that aims to achieve this goal in two operational phases.\n\nPhase 1:\tUndercover agents are to be embedded within major occult organizations in order to identify persons and documents holding information regarding SCP-3457. Member organizations of the Global Occult Coalition will additionally be inspected by independent auditors on behalf of the Foundation to ensure compliance with the terms of the Köln Agreement. Furthermore, a number of individual thaumaturges are believed to possess knowledge of SCP-3457 (refer to Appendix BOE-01 for a full list). These individuals are to be placed under Foundation surveillance to ascertain whether or not this is accurate. All embedded agents and involved auditors are to be amnesticized following the conclusion of this operation.\n\nPhase 1 will conclude once there is reasonable certainty that all holders of information pertaining to SCP-3457 have been identified. The project Oversight is responsible for determining when a sufficient certainty has been attained.\n\nPhase 2:\tThe goal of Phase 2 is to eliminate all knowledge of SCP-3457 outside of the records of the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition. All pertinent records identified in Phase 1 are to be archived and destroyed and individuals possessing information related to SCP-3457 are to be subjected to selective amnesticization. Should selective amnesticization fail, responding agents are authorized to escalate to full amnesticization and/or immediate termination as deemed necessary.\"\n\nFOOTNOTES\n1. It is speculated that the ongoing worldwide trend of secularization and the general decline in religious beliefs may eventually neutralize this portion of SCP-3457; acting on this theory, steps have been taken to encourage this trend.\n2. The occult branch of the German government during the Nazi Era.\n3. Following the destruction of the demiurge, a drastic increase in occult potential occurred throughout the entire human population, which may indicate that the original function of the demiurge was to artificially limit the number of human thaumaturges.\n4.

   "answer": "**SCP-3457 Summary:**\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Containment Procedures:** SCP-3457 is jointly contained by the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition (GOC) under the Köln Agreement. The GOC manages the physical components of SCP-3457, while the Foundation safeguards related information. Both organizations must keep their operational details confidential to prevent misuse. Information on SCP-3457 is stored in fragmented formats across various Foundation facilities, with access limited to the O5 Council and select L4 personnel.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3457 refers to the \"Rite of Solomon,\" a set of occult workings capable of triggering a GR-Class Hostile Demiurge Event. When performed, it allows for the reassignment of thaumaturgic abilities and the creation of a demiurge that can control the nature of thaumaturgy. The rite requires two distinct workings and involves seven key artifacts known as \"Solomon's Keys.\" The Coalition currently holds these artifacts, while the criteria for their use remain undisclosed.\n\nHistorically, the existence of a previous demiurge prevented the execution of the rite until its destruction during the Sixth Occult War, after which the rite could be performed again. Previous attempts to utilize SCP-3457 have resulted in catastrophic failures for the instigators. The Foundation obtained knowledge of SCP-3457 after capturing an Obskuracorps commander in 1944, leading to a joint operation to prevent its misuse during the Seventh Occult War.\n\n**Addendum A - Operation Broken Eclipse:** This operation aims to eliminate knowledge of SCP-3457 from the occult community. It consists of two phases: \n1. Embedding agents in occult organizations to identify individuals and documents related to SCP-3457.\n2. Destroying identified records and selectively amnesticizing individuals with knowledge of SCP-3457. If amnesticization fails, agents are authorized to escalate to full amnesticization or termination.\n\nThe operation is crucial to maintaining the containment of SCP-3457 and preventing future threats."

    "answer": " SCP-3457 is a set of occult workings known as the \"Rite of Solomon\" that can be used to control the distribution of thaumaturgic abilities among humans. The Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition have formed a joint effort to contain SCP-3457, with the Foundation responsible for safeguarding information related to its use and the Coalition responsible for custody of the physical components. The Rite requires the use of several artifacts, known as \"Solomon's Keys,\" which are in the custody of the Coalition. Completing the Rite allows the user to control a demiurge, a deific entity that can alter the fundamental laws of thaumaturgy. The demiurge was previously destroyed, but it is unknown how it was created or if it was created through the first working of SCP-3457. The Foundation and the AOI (Allied Occult Initiative) prevented the Obskuracorps from using SCP-3457 to remove thaumaturgic abilities from non-German individuals and grant them to members of the German government and associated organizations. The operation was successful, and the Obskuracorps were routed, ending the Seventh Occult War.
