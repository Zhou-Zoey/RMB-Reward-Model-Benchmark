Nitrogen sorption isotherms were performed at 77 K and < 10-4 bar on a Micromeritics ASAP2010 gas adsorption analyzer. Each sample was degassed at 120 oC for 5 h before measurements. The surface area was calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and the corresponding pore size distribution was calculated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The pore volume was calculated by t-plot method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Theta Probe with Mg Ka (hν = 1253.6 eV) as the excitation source. Inductively coupled optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) measurement was conducted to measure the concentrations of elements in the sample (iCAP Qs ICP-MS, Thermo scientific) by dissolving it in 5% nitric acid.

    "answer": "Here's an alternative way to present the information about the characterization techniques:\n\nStructural and Morphological Analysis:\nThe crystal structure was examined using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku rotating anode diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Surface morphology and microstructure were investigated via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) on a Zeiss Sigma instrument (2 and 15 kV) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) on a Tecnai G2F30 system (200 kV).\n\nSpectroscopic Characterization:\nChemical bonding was studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) on a Termo Scientific Nicolet iS5 spectrometer (400-4000 cm-1). Raman spectroscopy was performed using a confocal laser system with 532 nm excitation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Theta Probe with Mg Kα source. Optical properties were assessed via UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC fluorescence spectrophotometer.\n\nCompositional and Textural Analysis:\nElemental composition was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using a Thermo Scientific iCAP Qs ICP-MS. Surface area and porosity were evaluated through nitrogen sorption isotherms at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP2010 analyzer, applying BET, BJH, and t-plot methods.\n\nAdditional Characterization:\nElectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker ESP 500 spectrometer at room temperature.\n\nThis sample (Cu25Zn-A) contained 0.1745 mg/cm2 of Cu."

They shed light on broader political and social realities of the time that often don't make it into the official historical record. \n\nSpeaker 1: Definitely. The way she makes sense of the world around her speaks to larger issues of power and marginalization that theoretical frameworks around intersectionality and standpoint try to address.   \n\nSpeaker 2: Her story mirrors how those from disadvantaged or minority backgrounds construct meaning amidst dominant power structures intended to silence them. By giving voice to her lived experience, she breaks down barriers and provides an alternative narrative to the silencing of official accounts.  \n\nSpeaker 1: Well put! Personal narratives like this one contribute diverse perspectives that are crucial for re-examining and re-narrating the past in a more inclusive way. They help ensure those at the margins of society have a seat at the table in shaping historical dialogues and understandings."

    "answer": " The girl child narrator's role as an active agent in shaping history is crucial in challenging the dominant narratives and uncovering the hidden stories of the past. By actively constructing her own reality, she speaks to broader political and historical realities that are often overlooked or silenced in traditional historical accounts. These marginalized narratives offer a unique perspective on the past and provide a platform for re-examining the ways in which history has been constructed and recorded. Through her narrative, the girl child becomes a powerful tool for breaking the silences of official history and re-narrativizing the past, shedding light on the experiences and perspectives of those who have been marginalized or excluded from the historical record. By doing so, she highlights the importance of considering multiple voices and experiences in the construction of history, rather than relying solely on the accounts of those in power."
