Nitrogen sorption isotherms were performed at 77 K and < 10-4 bar on a Micromeritics ASAP2010 gas adsorption analyzer. Each sample was degassed at 120 oC for 5 h before measurements.

Surface morphology and microstructure were investigated via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) on a Zeiss Sigma instrument (2 and 15 kV) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) on a Tecnai G2F30 system (200 kV).\n\nSpectroscopic Characterization:\nChemical bonding was studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) on a Termo Scientific Nicolet iS5 spectrometer (400-4000 cm-1). Raman spectroscopy was performed using a confocal laser system with 532 nm excitation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Theta Probe with Mg Kα source. Optical properties were assessed via UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC fluorescence spectrophotometer.\n\nCompositional and Textural Analysis:\nElemental composition was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using a Thermo Scientific iCAP Qs ICP-MS. Surface area and porosity were evaluated through nitrogen sorption isotherms at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP2010 analyzer, applying BET, BJH, and t-plot methods.\n\nAdditional Characterization:\nElectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker ESP 500 spectrometer at room temperature.\n\nThis sample (Cu25Zn-A) contained 0.1745 mg/cm2 of Cu.",
