Because the word \"Euro\" starts with a consonant sound (even though it's spelled with a vowel), we use \"a\".\n\n**Therefore, the correct sentence is: Yesterday a Euro was given me for my work.**\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this sentence is a bit awkwardly phrased.

   "answer": "Ekanyunena Purvena Sutra is a Vedic mathematics technique used for multiplying numbers where one of the numbers is close to a power of 10 (like 99).\n\nHere's how it works for 15 x 99:\n\n* **Step 1: Identify the 'Ekanyunena Purvena' (One Less than the Previous):** \n   The number 99 is one less than 100.  So, the 'Ekanyunena Purvena' is 100 - 1 = 99.\n\n* **Step 2: Subtract the 'Ekanyunena Purvena' from the first number:**\n   Subtract 99 from 15:  15 - 99 = -84\n\n* **Step 3: Complement the result of Step 2:**\n   The complement of -84 is 100 - 84 = 16.  (Note: we consider only the positive part for complement)\n\n* **Step 4: Combine the results:**\n   Write the result from Step 2 (-84) and the complement from Step 3 (16) together:  -84 16\n\n* **Step 5: Adjust for borrowing:**\n   Since we had a negative result in Step 2, we need to borrow 1 from the left side. This changes -84 16 to -85 116\n\n* **Step 6: Ignore the negative sign:**\n   Ignore the negative sign and the answer is **1485**\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{1485}$."

When you first put the cough drop in your mouth, it has a relatively small surface area. As it dissolves, it becomes smaller and more rounded, increasing its surface area.

   "answer": " The correct answer is (c): Animals can only ever live in societies with a dominant male.\nIn many animal species, including primates, dolphins, and wolves, a dominant male is often preferred as a leader due to his ability to protect the group from threats and maintain order. In these societies, the dominant male is typically the largest and strongest individual, and he is responsible for defending the group and its territory from other males and predators.\nThe other options are not accurate reasons why a strong and dominant individual might be desired as a leader in an animal group:\n(a) Females of the group are not necessarily choosy when it comes to mating, and in many species, females are more likely to mate with the dominant male. However, this is not a universal rule, and some species have been observed to have more egalitarian mating systems where females have more control over their mates.\n(b) While conflicts between groups of animals do occur, they are not a universal feature of animal societies, and many species are able to coexist peacefully without a dominant male leading the group.\n(d) In some species, such as some primates and elephants, the group may be led by a female rather than a male, and in some cases, the group may be structured in a way that does not have a clear dominant individual."

In a two-dimensional coordinate system, such as the Cartesian plane, a point is represented by an ordered pair of numbers (x, y), where x is the horizontal distance from a reference line (usually called the x-axis) and y is the vertical distance from a reference line (usually called the y-axis).\n\nIn a three-dimensional coordinate system, a point is represented by an ordered triple of numbers (x, y, z), where x is the horizontal distance from a reference plane (usually called the xy-plane), y is the vertical distance from the xy-plane, and z is the distance perpendicular to the xy-plane.\n\nCoordinates are used in many areas of mathematics and science, including geometry, calculus, physics, engineering, and computer graphics. They are also widely used in navigation, surveying, and mapping."

Here's a breakdown of the term and concept:\n\n1. \"Inter-\" means \"between\" or \"among\"\n2. \"Specific\" refers to species\n\nSo, interspecific literally means \"between species.\"\n\nThis type of competition happens when different species in the same ecosystem compete for the same limited resources, such as food, water, space, or light. For example:\n\n- Different bird species competing for the same nesting sites\n- Various plant species competing for sunlight in a forest\n- Different predator species hunting the same prey\n\nIn contrast:\n\n- Intraspecific competition occurs between members of the same species.\n- The other options (nonspecific and ultraspecific) are not standard ecological terms used to describe competition between species.\n\nInterspecific competition is an important ecological concept as it can influence the distribution, abundance, and evolution of species within an ecosystem."

This type of competition is often seen in species that have a high population density or a complex social structure, where individuals are competing for limited resources within their own species.\nNonspecific competition, on the other hand, occurs when individuals of different species compete for the same resource, regardless of their own species. This type of competition is often seen in ecosystems where multiple species are competing for a limited resource.\nUltraspecific competition is not a type of competition that occurs between members of different species. Ultraspecific competition refers to competition between individuals of the same species that are very similar in terms of their morphology, behavior, or ecological niche."

They include rights such as the right to life, liberty, and property, which are often referred to as \"natural rights.\" According to Locke, individuals have these rights inherently, and the role of government is to protect them from infringement by others. In contrast, positive rights are rights that require others to take positive action to provide something, such as the right to healthcare or education.

Here's a simplified order:\n\n1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p...\n\n**How to Approach the Question**\n\n1. **Count the electrons:** Determine the total number of electrons in the given electron configuration.\n\n2. **Neutral Atom:**  If the configuration represents a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the atomic number, allowing you to identify the element on the periodic table.\n\n3. **Ions:** If the configuration represents an ion:\n   * **Positive Ion (Cation):**  Electrons have been removed.  Subtract the ion's charge from the number of electrons in the configuration to find the atomic number of the original neutral atom.\n   * **Negative Ion (Anion):** Electrons have been added. Add the ion's charge to the number of electrons in the configuration to find the atomic number of the original neutral atom.\n\n**Example**\n\nLet's say the given electron configuration was 1s² 2s² 2p⁶.\n\n1. **Count electrons:** 2 + 2 + 6 = 10 electrons\n\n2. **Neutral Atom or Ion?**  Since no charge is indicated, assume it's a neutral atom.\n\n3. **Identify the element:** An atom with 10 electrons has an atomic number of 10, which is Neon (Ne).\n\n**Answering Your Question**\n\nWithout the specific electron configuration, I can't provide the correct answer.  However, you can now use the steps above to determine the correct answer choice once you have the configuration.\n\n**Let me know if you have the electron configuration, and I'll gladly help you identify the species!** \n"

    "answer": "The electron configuration of an element refers to the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus of an atom. The Aufbau principle, also known as the Aufbau sequence, is a way of determining the electron configuration of elements. The principle states that an element will fill its lowest available energy level before moving on to the next level, and that electrons will occupy orbitals in order of decreasing energy.\n\nTo answer the question, we can use the Aufbau principle to determine which species has the electron configuration shown above.\n\nThe electron configuration shown above is 1s2 2s2 2p2, which corresponds to the element Potassium (K).\n\nTherefore, the species that has the electron configuration shown above is (C) K+."

    "answer": "1. Increases the lump sum needed at the beginning (time 0).\n2. Lowers the constant annual savings needed before year 17.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the Planning-for-College application, lowering the return on savings can have two main effects:\n\n1. Increases the lump sum needed at the beginning (time 0): When the return on savings is lower, the family needs to save more in the early years to reach the same amount as the future value. This means that the family needs to save a larger lump sum at the beginning to account for the lower return on investment.\n2. Lowers the constant annual savings needed before year 17: With a lower return on savings, the family needs to save less each year to reach the same amount as the future value. This means that the constant annual savings needed before year 17 is lower than it would be with a higher return on savings.\n\nTherefore, both options 1 and 2 are correct. Option 3 is incorrect because it does not affect the amount needed by end of year 17. Option 4 is incorrect because it is not related to the effect of lowering the return on savings."

This means that you will have less money available to pay for college tuition in the later years (years 18-20), so you will need to increase the amount you plan to pay for tuition during those years. The other options are not correct because lowering the return on savings does not directly affect the amount needed at the beginning, it does not keep the amount needed by the end of year 17 the same, and it does not lower the constant annual savings needed before year 17."

   "answer": "1. False - A dividend is a portion of a company's profits paid to shareholders.\n2. False - The higher the rate of interest, the more interest your money will earn.\n3. True\n4. False - A credit union is a financial institution that serves individuals and businesses with a specific commonality, such as working for the same company or living in the same area.\n5. True - The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures deposits at banks and thrift institutions for up to $250,000. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) insures deposits at credit unions for up to $250,000.\n6. True\n7. False - The more often interest is compounded, the more interest you make.\n8. True\n9. True\n10. True\n11. $760.00 - To find the simple interest, multiply the principal ($750) by the interest rate (4%) and by the time (1 year): $750 \\* 0.04 \\* 1 = $30 in interest. Add the interest to the principal to find the total amount: $750 + $30 = $780.00.\n12. all of these answers\n13. face value of the bond\n14. credit unions\n15. compound interest\n16. savings and loan associations\n17. a treasury bill - Treasury bills are short-term U.S. government securities that are sold at a discount and do not pay interest. They are sold with maturities of four, eight, 13, 26, and 52 weeks.\n18. principal\n19. credit union\n20. I savings bonds\n21. $64.00 - Use the compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A = amount, P = principal, r = interest rate, n = number of times interest is compounded per year, t = time in years. In this case, P = $400, r = 4%, n = 4 (quarterly), t = 1 year. Plug in the values to the formula: A = $400(1 + 0.04/4)^(4 \\* 1) = $400(1 + 0.01)^4 = $400 \\* 1.040608 = $416.24. The interest earned is the difference between the final amount and the principal: $416.24 - $400 = $16.24.\n22. $210 - The formula for simple interest is I = P \\* r \\* t, where I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years. Plug in the values to the formula: I = $200 \\* 0.06 \\* 1 = $12 in interest. Add the interest to the principal to find the total amount: $200 + $12 = $212.\n23. simple interest\n24. commercial bank, savings and loan association, or credit union - These types of financial institutions sell U.S. government savings bonds.\n25. credit union\n26. $561.80 - Use the compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A = amount, P = principal, r = interest rate, n = number of times interest is compounded per year, t = time in years. In this case, P = $500, r = 6%, n = 1 (annually), t = 2 years. Plug in the values to the formula: A = $500(1 + 0.06/1)^(1 \\* 2) = $500(1 + 0.06)^2 = $500 \\* 1.1236 = $561.80.\n27. bond\n28. a certificate of deposit or a money market account - These types of accounts typically pay higher interest rates than savings accounts.\n29. All of these answers - Interest can be compounded annually, quarterly, or daily.\n30. credit union\n31. 15 years - The rule of 72 states that you can divide the number 72 by the interest rate to estimate the number of years it will take to double your investment. In this case, 72 / 7 = 10.29 years to double the investment. However, since you cannot have a fraction of a year, round up to the nearest whole number, which is 15 years.\n32. 15 years - The rule of 72 states that you can divide the number 72 by the interest rate to estimate the number of years it will take to double your investment. In this case, 72 / 4.75 = 15.15 years to double the investment. However, since you cannot have a fraction of a year, round up to the nearest whole number, which is 15 years."

   "answer": "The correct answer is: **Cross-national differences in obesity are not only a function of portion size, but also reflect the meaning of food and eating (e.g., social activity versus physiological function).**\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **The \"French paradox\" refers to the fact that people in French settings tend to be less obese than people in American settings even though the French eat more (i.e., larger portions) than Americans do.**  This is partially true, but the paradox isn't solely about portion sizes. The French tend to eat richer foods but in smaller portions and with more emphasis on savoring and enjoying their meals. Their lifestyle also incorporates more walking and physical activity.\n\n* **The current, high rates of obesity in the USA are primarily genetic—that is, a function of that country's multi-ethnic nature (with many African and Indigenous American contributions to the gene pool).** While genetics play a role in individual predisposition to obesity, they cannot explain the rapid rise in obesity rates across the US in recent decades. Environmental and cultural factors are much more significant contributors.\n\n* **People in Mexican settings are more likely than people in USA settings to hold people responsible for controlling their body weight.** This is not necessarily true. Cultural attitudes towards body weight vary widely within both Mexico and the USA.\n\n**Why the correct answer is accurate:**\n\nCross-national differences in obesity rates are complex and influenced by a variety of factors, including:\n\n* **Portion sizes:** As seen in the French paradox, portion sizes do play a role.\n* **Food choices:** The types of food consumed, such as processed foods versus whole foods, significantly impact obesity rates.\n* **Cultural attitudes towards food:** In some cultures, food is primarily seen as fuel, while in others, it's a central part of social gatherings and celebrations.\n* **Levels of physical activity:**  Lifestyle factors like walking, cycling, and regular exercise contribute to overall health and weight management.\n* **Economic factors:** Access to affordable, healthy food options can influence dietary choices.\n\nTherefore, the answer highlighting the multifaceted nature of obesity across nations, encompassing portion sizes, cultural meanings of food, and eating habits, is the most accurate.\n"

The gas bill error: The bill should have been recorded as $420 but was recorded as $240. The error caused a $180 understatement of the expense ($420 - $240). Therefore, the suspense account should be credited for $180.\n2. The discount given error: The discount given should have been debited, but it was credited instead. Therefore, the suspense account should be debited for $50.\n3. The interest received error: The interest received should have been recorded in both the interest received account and the cash account. However, it was only recorded in the bank account. Therefore, the suspense account should be debited for $70.\n\nNow we can add up the amounts to find the net effect on the suspense account:\n\nDEBIT: $50 (discount error) + $70 (interest error) = $120\n\nCREDIT: $180 (gas bill error)\n\nSince the debit side is lower than the credit side, the suspense account should be debited for $160 to bring it into balance.

This decrease in price results in a higher effective yield for the buyer.\n\n**Let's illustrate with an example:**\n\n* **Bond Face Value:** $1,000\n* **Coupon Rate:** 5% (annual interest payment of $50)\n* **Required Rate of Return:** 6%\n\nSince investors can earn 6% elsewhere, they won't pay the full $1,000 for a bond only paying 5%. The bond's price will drop below $1,000 (selling at a discount) until its effective yield reaches 6%.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Face Value:** The bond would sell at face value if the coupon rate and required rate of return were equal.\n* **Cannot be determined without more information:**  While other factors can influence bond prices, the relationship between coupon rate and yield is fundamental.\n* **A Premium:** The bond would sell at a premium if the coupon rate were higher than the required rate of return.\n* **Strike Value:** Strike prices are associated with options, not bonds.\n\n**In summary, when the required rate of return is higher than the coupon rate, the bond must sell at a discount to compensate investors for the lower fixed interest payments.**\n"

    "answer": "When the market's required rate of return (yield) for a particular bond is higher than its coupon rate, the bond is selling at a discount.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Bond pricing is based on the present value of future cash flows (coupon payments and face value at maturity).\n\n2. The coupon rate is fixed when the bond is issued, but market interest rates (yields) fluctuate over time.\n\n3. When the market yield is higher than the coupon rate:\n   - Investors demand a higher return than what the bond's coupon offers.\n   - To compensate for this, the bond's price must decrease below its face value.\n   - This lower price allows investors to achieve the higher yield they require.\n\n4. Selling at a discount means the bond's market price is below its face value.\n\n5. This discount allows investors to effectively earn the higher market yield through a combination of coupon payments and the capital gain realized when the bond matures at face value.\n\nConversely:\n- If the market yield equals the coupon rate, the bond sells at face value.\n- If the market yield is lower than the coupon rate, the bond sells at a premium (above face value).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: a discount."

This happens when the market's required rate of return (yield) is higher than the bond's coupon rate.\n\nHere's why:\n1. If the market's required rate of return is higher than the bond's coupon rate, investors will not be willing to pay the face value for the bond, as they can get better returns elsewhere.\n2. To compensate for the lower coupon rate, the bond's price must decrease to make it attractive to investors.\n3. When the bond's price is lower than its face value, it is said to be selling at a discount.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n- Face value: This is when the bond's price is equal to its par value, which occurs when the coupon rate and the market's required rate of return are the same.\n- Premium: This is when the bond's price is higher than its face value, which happens when the coupon rate is higher than the market's required rate of return.\n- Strike value: This term is not applicable to bonds; it is used in the context of options trading.\n- Cannot be determined without more information: In this case, the question provides enough information to determine that the bond is selling at a discount."

The graph also has a cycle of length 6, which means that there is a path that visits each vertex exactly twice.\n3.

   "answer": " The equation provided is:\n\n-41(0.0997)**0 + 31 = estimated sound pressure level (decibels)\n\nThis equation is a formula for calculating the estimated sound pressure level in decibels (dB) at a specific octave band centre frequency (Hz), using the noise criterion rating (NC) and the frequency weighting factor (F) which is 0.0997 for the background conference room.\n\nThe noise criterion rating (NC) is a measure of the maximum acceptable sound level in a given environment. In this case, the noise criterion rating is 25, which means that the estimated sound pressure level should not exceed 25 dB.\n\nThe equation has three variables:\n\n* -41: This is the reference sound pressure level in decibels, which is the sound pressure level that corresponds to the noise criterion rating of 25.\n* 0.0997: This is the frequency weighting factor, which takes into account the frequency of the sound.\n* 31: This is the offset sound pressure level, which is the sound pressure level that is added to the reference sound pressure level to account for other sounds that may be present in the environment.\n\nNow, let's interpret the equation:\n\na. 3 is not equal to 41 less than the estimated sound pressure level, in decibels, at an octave band centre frequency of 60 hertz.\n\nb. 31 is equal to 41 less than the estimated sound pressure level, in decibels, at an octave band centre frequency of 0 hertz.

    "answer": " Great, let's dive into the problems with the Waterfall methodology and the Agile manifesto!\nProblems with the Waterfall methodology:\n1. Requirements may change during development, which affects deadlines and may require phases to be repeated: The Waterfall methodology assumes that all requirements are fixed and known at the beginning of the project, but in reality, requirements can change during development, leading to delays and repeated phases.\n2. Because the phases are sequential, any delays in one phase will slow down the entire development process: The Waterfall methodology follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next one. This means that any delays in one phase will affect the entire development process, leading to delays and inefficiencies.\nProblems with the Agile manifesto:\n1. We value working software over comprehensive documentation: Agile emphasizes delivering working software in short iterations, rather than spending excessive time on documentation. This approach prioritizes delivering value to customers over following a plan.\n2. We value responding to change over following a plan: Agile recognizes that plans are likely to change during development and prioritizes adapting to those changes rather than sticking to a rigid plan.\nThe correct answer for question 2 is:\nWe value responding to change over following a plan.\nThe correct answer for question 3 is:\nWe value working software over comprehensive documentation."

False Acceptance Rate (FAR):\n   This is the rate at which the system incorrectly accepts an impostor as a genuine user. In the context of a spoofing attack, the attacker is trying to fool the system into accepting them as a legitimate user. If the spoofing attack is successful, it will increase the number of times the system incorrectly accepts the attacker, thus increasing the FAR.\n\n2. False Rejection Rate (FRR):\n   This is the rate at which the system incorrectly rejects a genuine user. A spoofing attack doesn't directly affect genuine users' interactions with the system, so it wouldn't typically impact the FRR.\n\n3. Equal Error Rate (EER):\n   This is the rate at which the FAR and FRR are equal. While a successful spoofing attack would increase the FAR, it doesn't necessarily affect the FRR. Therefore, it doesn't directly increase the EER.\n\n4. A and C:\n   This option suggests that both FAR and EER would increase. While FAR would indeed increase, as explained above, the EER doesn't necessarily increase directly as a result of a spoofing attack.\n\nIn a successful spoofing attack, an impostor is able to pass the Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) system by mimicking a genuine user or using synthetic speech. This directly increases the system's tendency to incorrectly accept impostors, which is measured by the False Acceptance Rate (FAR).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: False Acceptance Rate (FAR)."

A successful spoofing attack will increase both the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and the Equal Error Rate (EER) of an ASV system.\n\nWhen a spoofing attack is successful, the attacker's voice is misclassified as the legitimate user's voice, leading to a false acceptance. This increases the FAR, which is the proportion of false acceptances among all genuine attempts.\n\nAdditionally, a successful spoofing attack also increases the EER, which is the rate at which both legitimate and illegitimate attempts are misclassified. This is because the attacker's voice may be similar enough to the legitimate user's voice that the ASV system cannot distinguish between them, leading to an increased rate of errors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D, which states that a successful spoofing attack will increase both FAR and EER."

We can assume that all of the water evaporated was from the solute, so the mass of the solute in the final solution is 0.116 g - 0.098 g = 0.018 g.\n\nThe density of water is 1 g/mL, so the mass of water in the final solution is 0.018 g / 1 g/mL = 0.018 mL.\n\nSince the mass of the dry solute is 0.116 g and the mass of the solute in the final solution is 0.018 g, the concentration of the solute in the final solution is 0.018 g/mL.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 0.018 g/mL"

    "answer": "To find the concentration of the solute in the solution, we first need to determine the mass of the solute and the volume of the solvent (water).\n\nThe mass of the solute is given as 0.116 g, so we need to calculate the mass of the solvent (water). We know that the mass of the water evaporated is 0.098 g, which means that the initial mass of the water must have been the mass of the final solution minus the mass of the evaporated water.\n\nThe mass of the water = mass of final solution - mass of evaporated water\n= 0.116 g (solute) + 0.098 g (evaporated water) - 0.098 g (evaporated water)\n= 0.116 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of the solvent using its density. Since the density of water is 1 g/mL, we can assume that the mass of the water is equal to the volume (as 1 mL of water has a mass of 1 g):\n\nVolume of solvent (water) = mass of water / density of water\n= 0.116 g / 1 g/mL\n= 0.116 mL\n\nNow, we can calculate the concentration of the solute as the mass of the solute divided by the volume of the solvent:\n\nConcentration (g solute/mL solvent) = mass of solute / volume of solvent\n= 0.116 g / 0.116 mL\n= 1 g/mL\n\nHowever, we need to express the concentration in the given units of g solute/mL solvent, so we need to divide our result by 1000:\n\nConcentration = (1 g/mL) / 1000\n= 0.001 g/mL\n\nTherefore, the concentration is closer to option B: 0.011 g/mL. However, since we performed a division by 1000, the correct option should be:\n\nB. 0.011 g/mL"

In the last century the average temperature rose about 0.6 degrees C around the world. From the melting of the ice cap on Mt Kilimanjaro, Africa's tallest peak, to the loss of coral reefs as oceans become warmer, the effects of global warming are often clear. Many experts warn that global warming will cause sea levels to rise dramatically. In the past 100 years the oceans have risen 10 to 20 cms - but that's nothing compared to what would happen if, for example, Greenland's massive ice sheet were to melt. The consequences would be catastrophic,\" says\n\nJonathan Overpeck, Director of the Institute for the Study of Planet Earth at the University of Arizona. \"Even with a small sea level rise, we're going to destroy a number of nations and cultures that have existed for thousands of years.

However, the exact link, if any, between the increase in carbon dioxide emissions and the higher temperatures is still being disputed. Most scientists believe that humans, by burning fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum, are largely to blame for the increase in carbon dioxide. But some scientists also point to natural causes, such as volcanic activity. 'Many uncertainties surround global warming,' says Ronald Stouffer at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. 'How much of it would still occur if humans were not changing the climate in any way?'\n\nC\n\nThe current rate of warming is faster than ever before, however, which suggests it probably is not a natural occurrence. And a large number of scientists believe the rise in temperatures will, in fact, speed up. The UN Group on Climate Change reported in 2001 that the average temperature is likely to increase by between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees C by the year 2100. The climate change is likely to impact on ecosystems, agriculture and the spread of disease. 'Global warming is a serious threat to animal and plant life,' says Jay Malcolm, a forestry professor at the University of Toronto.

That is something many scientists think is likely to happen in another hundred years. The complete melting of the Greenland ice cap would raise sea levels by seven metres. Even a partial melting would cause a one-metre rise. Such a rise would have a devastating impact on low-lying islands, such as the Maldives, which would be entirely submerged. Densely populated areas like the Nile Delta and parts of Bangladesh would become uninhabitable, affecting hundreds of millions of people. A one-metre sea-level rise would flood the eastern seaboard of the USA.\n\nE \n\nOther scientists emphasise that such doomsday scenarios may be hundreds of years in the future. \"You can't say with any certainly that sea-level rises are going to have a huge impact on society,\" says Stouffer \"Who knows what the planet will look like 5000 years from now?
